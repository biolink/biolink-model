# Biolink Model

Quickstart docs:

 * Browse the model: [https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model)
    * [named thing](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/docs/NamedThing.html) (root class for all things)
    * [association](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/docs/Association.html) (root class for associations)
    * [slots](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/docs/#slots)

See [Introduction to the Biolink datamodel](https://www.slideshare.net/cmungall/introduction-to-the-biolink-datamodel)
slides for a background on the Biolink Model and its inception.

See also [Biolink Model Guidelines](./guidelines/index.md) for understanding, curating and working with the model.

Conversion/validation code: https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/kgx

## Introduction

The purpose of the Biolink model is to provide a high level datamodel of
biological entities (genes, diseases, phenotypes, pathways, individuals, substances, etc),
their properties, relationships, and enumerate ways in which they can be associated.

The representation is independent of storage technology or metamodel (Solr documents, neo4j/property graphs,
RDF/OWL, JSON, CSVs, etc). Different mappings to each of these are provided.

The specification of the reference Biolink model is a [single YAML file](biolink-model.yaml) following
a custom meta-model. The basic elements of the YAML are:

 - definitions of upper level *classes* representing both 'named thing'
(genes, phenotypes, etc) and 'association'
 - definitions of *slots* (aka properties) that can be used to relate
   members of these classes to other classes or data types

This datamodel is being used in the NCATS Translator project. Not all these elements in the
datamodel are used by the Translator; only a subset.

### Entity (Node) Types

 * [named thing](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/docs/NamedThing.html) (root class for all things)

Protege view:

### Association Hierarchy

 * [association](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/docs/Association.html) (root class for association types)


### Slots

 * [slots](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/docs/#slots)

We divide these into *relationship types* (which connect two nodes together), *node properties* and *edge properties*.



## Identifiers

See [biolink json-ld context](context.jsonld) to find out more about identifier prefixes and their mappings.


## Mapping to specific database and modeling platforms

### Neo4J Mapping

Refer to [mapping to neo4j](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/about/mapping-neo4j.html) for strategies on
representing Biolink model in a Neo4j database.

### RDF Mapping

Refer to [mapping to RDF and RDF*](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/about/mapping-rdf.html) for strategies on
representing Biolink model in a RDF triple store.



## Organization

The datamodel source is [biolink-model.yaml](biolink-model.yaml). This is a YAML file that is intended to
be relatively simple to view and edit in its native form.

The yaml definition is currently used to derive:

 - [GOlr YAML schemas](golr-views)
    - these can be compiled down to Solr XML schemas
    - these are also intermediate targets used within the BBOP/AmiGO framework
 - [JSON Schema](json-schema)
 - [Python dataclasses](biolink/model.py)
 - [marshmallow schema definitions](biolink/schema.py)
    - can be used to serialize/deserialize python object model to JSON and YAML
 - [Java code gen](java)
    - [Jackson annotations](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations) used be default
    - generated from JSON schema
 - [ProtoBuf definitions](proto)
 - [ontology](ontology)
 - [graphviz](graphviz) to replace existing cmaps
 - [markdown docs](docs)
 - JSON-LD contexts (TODO)

We leverage existing frameworks where possible. E.g json-schema allows codegen to other languages.

Additionally, this repo contains the metamodel definition of itself in YAML, together with code for
working with datamodels. In theory this could be used in other domains but there is no plan for this
at the moment.

## Metamodel

See [metamodel](metamodel) for details of the metamodel.


## Make and build instructions

Prerequisites: Python 3.7+ and pipenv:

```sh
pip3 install pipenv
```

To install the project:
```sh
make install
```

If you make changes to [biolink-model.yaml](biolink-model.yaml) then be sure to run the Makefile to generate
up-to-date artifacts and documentation.

```sh
make
```


**Note:** the Makefile requires the following dependencies to be installed:

### jsonschema

[jsonschema](https://json-schema.org/)

Generally install using 

```sh
pip3 install jsonschema
```

### jsonschema2pojo

[jsonschema2pojo](https://github.com/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo)

If you are on a Mac, it can be installed using `brew`:
```sh
brew install jsonschema2pojo
```
For other OS environments, download the latest release then extract it into your execution path.

### GraphViz

See [GraphViz site](https://graphviz.org/) for installation in your operating system.

## Usage in existing projects

### Case study: gene expression in Monarch

Currently this is documented in the [ingest artifacts](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/ingest-artifacts/tree/master/sources)
repo, using non-computable cmap images:

![bgee model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monarch-initiative/ingest-artifacts/master/sources/BGee/Bgee_20170112.jpg)

And also by the [gene-anatomy cypher query](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-cypher-queries/blob/master/src/main/cypher/golr-loader/gene-anatomy.yaml)
which maps graphs conforming to the pattern to denormalized tuples for indexing in Solr

In the Biolink model this is explicitly represented using the `gene to expression site association` class definition
[in the model](biolink-model.yaml)

```yaml
  - name: gene to expression site association
    is_a: association
    description: >-
      An association between a gene and an expression site, possibly qualified by stage/timing info
    see_also: "https://github.com/monarch-initiative/ingest-artifacts/tree/master/sources/BGee"
    slot_usage:
      - slot: subject
        type: gene or gene product
        description: "gene in which variation is correlated with the phenotypic feature"
      - slot: object
        type: anatomical entity
        description: "location in which the gene is expressed"
        subclass_of: UBERON:0001062
        examples:
          - value: UBERON:0002037
            description: cerebellum
      - slot: relation
        description: "expression relationship"
        subproperty_of: "RO:0002206"
      - slot: stage
        type: developmental stage
        description: "stage at which the gene is expressed in the site"
        examples:
          - value: UBERON:0000069
            description: larval stage
      - slot: quantifier
        description: >-
          can be used to indicate magnitude, or also ranking
```

This is used to generate various artifacts such as

 - [golr view definition](golr-views/gene_to_expression_site_association-config.yaml)
    - (which is itself later compiled to Solr XML using the BBOP-GOlrframework)
 - [java class](java/GeneToExpressionSiteAssociation.java)
    - generated from json-schema, so inheritance is unfolded
    - in future we may generate directly

## FAQ

### Why not use X as the modeling framework?

Why invent our own yaml and not use JSON-Schema, SQL, UML, ProtoBuf, OWL, etc.

Each of these is tied to a particular formalisms, e.g. JSON Schema to trees,
OWL to open world logic. There are various impedance mismatches in converting between these.
The goal was to develop something simple and more general that is not tied to any one serialization format
or set of assumptions.

There are other projects with similar goals, e.g [Schema Salad](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/schema_salad)

It may be possible to align with these.

### Why not use X as the datamodel

Here X may be BioSchemas, some upper ontology (BioTop), UMLS metathesaurus, bio*, various other
attempts to model all of biology in an object model.

Currently as far as we know there is no existing reference datamodel that is flexible enough to be used here.

### How do I use Biolink Model YAML programatically?

For operations such as CURIE lookup, finding class by synonyms, get parents, get ancestors, etc. please make use of [biolink-model-toolkit](https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model-toolkit/). It provides a convenience methods for traversing Biolink Model.
