The Biolink Model is a high-level, open-source data model designed to standardize types and relationships in biological
knowledge graphs, covering entities like genes, diseases, chemical substances, organisms, genomics, phenotypes, and
more.  Biolink Model can be used to formalize the relationships between data structures in
translational science. It incorporates object-oriented classification and graph-oriented features. The core of the
model is a set of hierarchical, interconnected classes (or categories) and relationships between them (or predicates).
The model provides class and edge attributes and associations that guide how entities should relate to one another.
The goal of the Biolink Model is to provide a consistent framework for representing biological knowledge across various
databases and formats.  For more information, see: [understanding the model](understanding-the-model.md)
