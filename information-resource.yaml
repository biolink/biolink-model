## PREFIXES
## ------------
# CURIE namespaces (prefixes/base URI's) mappings of prefixes used in the body of the Biolink Model specification
# are resolved using a specific precedence order, for use in the generation of the Biolink Model context.jsonld
# mappings to namespaces. Any prefixes encountered in the Biolink Model but not resolved by the following
# precedence sources, are anonymously declared by linkml as http://example.org/UNKNOWN/ rooted base URI's
# which should ideally be repaired in one of the precedence lists.
#
# 1. The following 'prefixes:' delimited list has first precedence in resolution.

prefixes:
  biolink: 'https://w3id.org/biolink/vocab/'
  linkml: 'https://w3id.org/linkml/'

      A database or knowledgebase and its supporting ecosystem of interfaces 
      and services that deliver content to consumers (e.g. web portals, APIs, 
      query endpoints, streaming services, data downloads, etc.).
      A single Information Resource by this definition may span many different datasets or
      databases, and include many access endpoints and user
      interfaces. Information Resources include project-specific resources
      such as a Translator Knowledge Provider, and community knowledgebases like ChemBL, OMIM, or DGIdb.

  knowledge level:
    range: KnowledgeLevelEnum
    description: >-
        The level of knowledge that supports an edge or node.  This is a general
        categorization of the type of evidence that supports a statement, and is
        not intended to be a comprehensive description of the evidence.  For
        example, a statement may be supported by a single publication, but that
        publication may contain multiple types of evidence, such as a
        computational prediction and a manual curation.  In this case, the
        knowledge level would be "curated", and the evidence would be described
        in more detail in the evidence graph.
  agent type:
    range: AgentTypeEnum
    description: >-
        The type of agent that supports an edge or node.  This is a general
        categorization of the type of agent that supports a statement, and is
        not intended to be a comprehensive description of the agent.  For
        example, a statement may be supported by a single publication, but that
        publication may contain multiple types of evidence, such as a
        computational prediction and a manual curation.  In this case, the
        agent type would be "publication", and the evidence would be described
        in more detail in the evidence graph.
