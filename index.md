# Biolink Model

A high level datamodel of biological entities ([genes](docs/Gene), [diseases](docs/Disease),
[phenotypes](docs/Phenotype), [pathways](docs/Pathway), [individuals](docs/IndividualOrganism), [substances](docs/ChemicalSubstance), etc) and their
[associations](docs/Association).

Biolink Model is designed as a way of standardizing types and relational structures in knowledge graphs (KGs), 
where the KG may be either a property graph or RDF triple store.

The schema is expressed as a [YAML](https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model/blob/master/biolink-model.yaml), which is translated to:

 * Individual pages for each class in the model, e.g [https://w3id.org/biolink/vocab/Gene](https://w3id.org/biolink/vocab/Gene)
 * An [OWL ontology](biolink-model.owl.ttl), also available on [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/BIOLINK)
 * [Python dataclasses](biolink/model.py), also available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/biolink-model/)
 * [ShEx](biolink-model.shex) (RDF shape constraints)
 * [graphql](biolink-model.graphql) 
 * [protobuf](biolink-model.proto) 
 * [json-schema](json-schema/biolink-model.json) 
 * [prefix-mapping](prefix-map/biolink-model-prefix-map.json)  (A simple mapping of prefix to IRI expansion)
 * [java classes](java/BiolinkModel.java)

## Datamodel

The schema assumes a property graph, where nodes represent individual entities, and edges represent relationship 
between entities. Biolink Model provides a schema for representing both nodes and edges.


The model itself can be divided into a few parts,
* Entities (subjects and objects)
* Predicates (relationships between core concepts)
* Associations (statements including evidence and provenance)
* Entity Slots (node properties)
* Edge Slots (edge properties)

### Entities

A entity corresponds to a database entity or a concept, represented as a node in a property graph.

All typed entities are a sub-class of [NamedThing](docs/NamedThing).
 

Each entity has,
- its own unique stable URI
- mappings to other ontologies (SIO, SO, etc.)
- list of valid ID prefixes

These entity types are higher level terms that can be used to categorize nodes in a KG. 

For more detailed typing, one can use specific terms from an ontology.


### Associations

A typed association between two entities, usually supported by evidence and provenance. 
An association is represented as an edge/relationship between two nodes, in a property graph.

All edges are a sub-class of [Association](docs/Association).

An association connects a subject node and an object node via a [relation](docs/relation) property.
The nature of the association is defined based on the [relation](docs/relation) property.

Certain associations can have additional properties like [provided_by](docs/provided_by), 
[has_evidence](docs/has_evidence), [publications](docs/publications).


### Slots

[Slots](docs#slots) are used to collectively refer to, both, node and edge properties.

There are two types of slots defined in the model,
- [node property](docs/node_property) - all node properties are a sub-class of [node property](docs/node_property)
- [association slot](docs/association_slot) - all edge properties are a sub-class of [association slot](docs/association_slot)

# Identifiers

See [Biolink Model JSON-LD context](context.jsonld) for a list of CURIE prefix mappings.

These include prefix expansions such as:

      "CHEBI": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHEBI_",
      "NCBIGene": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/",
      "NCIT": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_",


> **Note:** We do not curate these in Biolink Model. Rather we take these from upstream sources, 
via PrefixCommons. We specify a priority order of upstream sources in cases where conflicts may occur. 
See the [default_curi_maps](https://biolink.github.io/biolinkml/docs/default_curi_maps) tag at the 
top of the [biolink-model.yaml](biolink-model.yaml). 

We also specify a small set of top-level prefix overrides via the [prefixes](https://biolink.github.io/biolinkml/docs/prefixes) 
tag at the top of the YAML.


# Biolink Model representation

Biolink Model aims at representing knowledge in a graph form regardless of the graph representation used.

Following are some recommendations when attempting to use Biolink Model with each style of representation. 

- **Neo4J**: see [Mapping to Neo4j](about/mapping-neo4j)
- **RDF**: see [Mapping to RDF](about/mapping-rdf)
