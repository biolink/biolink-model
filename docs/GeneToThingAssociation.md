## Fields

 * [gene to thing association.subject](gene_to_thing_association_subject.md)
    * Description: gene that is the subject of the association
    * range: [GeneOrGeneProduct](GeneOrGeneProduct.md) [required]
    * __Local__
 * [association slot](association_slot.md)
    * Description: any slot that relates an association to another entity
    * range: **string**
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [association type](association_type.md)
    * Description: connects an association to the type of association (e.g. gene to phenotype)
