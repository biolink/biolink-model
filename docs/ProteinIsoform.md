## Parents

 *  is_a: [Protein](Protein.md) - A gene product that is composed of a chain of amino acid sequences and is produced by ribosome-mediated translation of mRNA

## Uses Mixins

 *  mixin: [GeneProductIsoform](GeneProductIsoform.md) - This is an abstract class that can be mixed in with different kinds of gene products to indicate that the gene product is intended to represent a specific isoform rather than a canonical or reference or generic product. The designation of canonical or reference may be arbitrary, or it may represent the superclass of all isoforms.
