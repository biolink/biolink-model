### Inherited from association:

 * [id](association_id.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>

 * [association type](association_type.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the type of association (e.g. gene to phenotype)

    * range: [SeverityValue](SeverityValue.md)
    * inherited from: [EntityToFeatureOrDiseaseQualifiers](EntityToFeatureOrDiseaseQualifiers.md)
 * [onset qualifier](onset_qualifier.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
