## Fields

 * [sequence variant qualifier](sequence_variant_qualifier.html)
    * _a qualifier used in an association where the variant_
    * __range__: [sequence variant](SequenceVariant.html)
    * __Local__
 * [association type](association_type.html)
    * _connects an association to the type of association (e.g. gene to phenotype)_
    * __range__: [ontology class](OntologyClass.html)
    * inherited from: [association](Association.html)
 * [subject](subject.html)
    * _A gene that has a role in modeling the disease. This may be a model organism ortholog of a known disease gene, or it may be a gene whose mutants recapitulate core features of the disease._
    * __range__: [gene or gene product](GeneOrGeneProduct.html) [required]
    * inherited from: [association](Association.html)
