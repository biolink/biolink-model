## Mappings

## Inheritance

 *  is_a: [Association](Association.md) - A typed association between two entities, supported by evidence
## Children

 * [GenotypeToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation](GenotypeToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation.md) (mixin)  - Any association between one genotype and a phenotypic feature, where having the genotype confers the phenotype, either in isolation or through environment
## Used in

    * Description: An IRI for the node. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.
    * range: [IriType](IriType.md)
    * inherited from: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
 * [name](name.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)
    * Description: A human-readable name for a thing
    * range: [LabelType](LabelType.md)
    * inherited from: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
 * [negated](negated.md)

    * Description: A grouping for any property that holds between a node and a value
    * range: **string**
    * inherited from: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
 * [object](object.md)
    * Description: connects an association to the object of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
