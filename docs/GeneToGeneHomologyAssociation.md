# Class: gene to gene homology association


A homology association between two genes. May be orthology (in which case the species of subject and object should differ) or paralogy (in which case the species may be the same)

 * [gene to gene association.object](gene_to_gene_association_object.md)
    * Description: the object gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric, subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as proxy for the gene or vice versa

 * [gene to gene association.subject](gene_to_gene_association_subject.md)
    * Description: the subject gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric, subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as proxy for the gene or vice versa
    * range: [GeneOrGeneProduct](GeneOrGeneProduct.md) [required]
    * inherited from: [GeneToGeneAssociation](GeneToGeneAssociation.md)
 * [negated](negated.md)
    * Description: if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true
    * range: **boolean**
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [provided by](provided_by.md)
    * Description: connects an association to the agent (person, organization or group) that provided it

 * [publications](publications.md)
    * Description: connects an association to publications supporting the association
