## Mappings

## Inheritance

 *  is_a: [Association](Association.md) - A typed association between two entities, supported by evidence
## Children

 * [GeneToGeneHomologyAssociation](GeneToGeneHomologyAssociation.md) - A homology association between two genes. May be orthology (in which case the species of subject and object should differ) or paralogy (in which case the species may be the same)
 * [PairwiseGeneToGeneInteraction](PairwiseGeneToGeneInteraction.md) - An interaction between two genes or two gene products. May be physical (e.g. protein binding) or genetic (between genes). May be symmetric (e.g. protein interaction) or directed (e.g. phosphorylation)
## Used in

## Fields

 * [gene to gene association.object](gene_to_gene_association_object.md)
    * Description: the object gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric, subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as proxy for the gene or vice versa
    * range: [GeneOrGeneProduct](GeneOrGeneProduct.md) [required]
    * __Local__
 * [gene to gene association.subject](gene_to_gene_association_subject.md)
    * Description: the subject gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric, subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as proxy for the gene or vice versa
    * range: [GeneOrGeneProduct](GeneOrGeneProduct.md) [required]
    * __Local__
 * [association slot](association_slot.md)
    * Description: any slot that relates an association to another entity
    * range: **string**
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [association type](association_type.md)
    * Description: connects an association to the type of association (e.g. gene to phenotype)
    * range: [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md)
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [association.id](association_id.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)
    * Description: A unique identifier for an association
    * range: [IdentifierType](IdentifierType.md)
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [negated](negated.md)
    * Description: if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true
    * range: **boolean**
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [provided by](provided_by.md)
    * Description: connects an association to the agent (person, organization or group) that provided it
    * range: [Provider](Provider.md)
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [publications](publications.md)
    * Description: connects an association to publications supporting the association
    * range: [Publication](Publication.md)*
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [qualifiers](qualifiers.md)
    * Description: connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning of that association
    * range: [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md)*
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [relation](relation.md)
    * Description: the relationship type by which a subject is connected to an object in an association
    * range: [IriType](IriType.md) [required]
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
