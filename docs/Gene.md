### Inherited from named thing:

 * [id](id.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A unique identifier for a thing. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
    * range: [IdentifierType](types/IdentifierType.md)
    * inherited from: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [name](name.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A human-readable name for a thing
    * range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
    * inherited from: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [category](category.md)  <sub>1..*</sub>
    * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag
    * range: [IriType](types/IriType.md)
    * inherited from: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)

### Inherited from thing with taxon:

 * [in taxon](in_taxon.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects a thing to a class representing a taxon
    * range: [OrganismTaxon](OrganismTaxon.md)
    * inherited from: [ThingWithTaxon](ThingWithTaxon.md)

### Domain for slot:

 * [gene associated with condition](gene_associated_with_condition.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: holds between a gene and a disease or phenotypic feature that the gene or its alleles/products may influence, contribute to, or correlate with
    * range: [DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature](DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [genetically interacts with](genetically_interacts_with.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: holds between two genes whose phenotypic effects are dependent on each other in some way - such that their combined phenotypic effects are the result of some interaction between the activity of their gene products. Examples include epistasis and synthetic lethality.

    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [has gene product](has_gene_product.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: holds between a gene and a transcribed and/or translated product generated from it
    * range: [GeneProduct](GeneProduct.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
