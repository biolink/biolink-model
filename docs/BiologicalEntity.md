## Children

 * [BiologicalProcessOrActivity](BiologicalProcessOrActivity.md) - Either an individual molecular activity, or a collection of causally connected molecular activities
 * [DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature](DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature.md) - Either one of a disease or an individual phenotypic feature. Some knowledge resources such as Monarch treat these as distinct, others such as MESH conflate.
 * [Environment](Environment.md) - A feature of the environment of an organism that influences one or more phenotypic features of that organism, potentially mediated by genes
 * [MolecularEntity](MolecularEntity.md) - A gene, gene product, small molecule or macromolecule (including protein complex)

    * range: [Phenotype](Phenotype.md)
    * __Local__
 * [category](category.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)
    * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag
    * range: [IriType](IriType.md)*
    * inherited from: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
 * [description](description.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)
    * Description: a human-readable description of a thing
    * range: [NarrativeText](NarrativeText.md)

    * inherited from: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
 * [iri](iri.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)
    * Description: An IRI for the node. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.

    * range: **string**
    * inherited from: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
