 * [name](name.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A human-readable name for a thing

 * [category](category.md)  <sub>1..*</sub>
    * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag
