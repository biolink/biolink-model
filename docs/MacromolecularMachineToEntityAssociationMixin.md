## Mixin for

 * [MacromolecularMachineToBiologicalProcessAssociation](MacromolecularMachineToBiologicalProcessAssociation.md) (mixin)  - A functional association between a macromolecular machine (gene, gene product or complex) and a biological process or pathway (as represented in the GO biological process branch), where the entity carries out some part of the process, regulates it, or acts upstream of it.
 * [MacromolecularMachineToCellularComponentAssociation](MacromolecularMachineToCellularComponentAssociation.md) (mixin)  - A functional association between a macromolecular machine (gene, gene product or complex) and a cellular component (as represented in the GO cellular component branch), where the entity carries out its function in the cellular component.
 * [MacromolecularMachineToMolecularActivityAssociation](MacromolecularMachineToMolecularActivityAssociation.md) (mixin)  - A functional association between a macromolecular machine (gene, gene product or complex) and a molecular activity (as represented in the GO molecular function branch), where the entity carries out the activity, or contributes to its execution.
