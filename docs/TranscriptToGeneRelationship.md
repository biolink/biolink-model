 * [relation](relation.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: the relationship type by which a subject is connected to an object in an association
    * range: [Uriorcurie](Uriorcurie.md)
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [object](object.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the object of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.

    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [negated](negated.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true
    * range: [Boolean](Boolean.md)
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [association type](association_type.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the type of association (e.g. gene to phenotype)
    * range: [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md)
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [qualifiers](qualifiers.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning of that association
    * range: [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md)

    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [provided by](provided_by.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the agent (person, organization or group) that provided it
