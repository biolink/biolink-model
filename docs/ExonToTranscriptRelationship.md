## Fields

 * [exon to transcript relationship.object](exon_to_transcript_relationship_object.md)
    * Description: connects an association to the object of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
    * range: [Transcript](Transcript.md) [required]
    * __Local__
 * [exon to transcript relationship.subject](exon_to_transcript_relationship_subject.md)
    * Description: connects an association to the subject of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
    * range: [Exon](Exon.md) [required]
