## Fields

 * [variant to thing association.subject](variant_to_thing_association_subject.md)
    * Description: a sequence variant in which the allele state is associated with some other entity
    * range: [SequenceVariant](SequenceVariant.md) [required]
    * __Local__
 * [association slot](association_slot.md)
    * Description: any slot that relates an association to another entity
    * range: **string**
    * inherited from: [Association](Association.md)
 * [association type](association_type.md)
    * Description: connects an association to the type of association (e.g. gene to phenotype)
    * range: [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md)
