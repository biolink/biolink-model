## Fields

 * [gene regulatory relationship.object](gene_regulatory_relationship_object.md)
    * Description: connects an association to the object of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
    * range: [GeneOrGeneProduct](GeneOrGeneProduct.md) [required]
    * __Local__
 * [gene regulatory relationship.relation](gene_regulatory_relationship_relation.md)
    * Description: the direction is always from regulator to regulated
    * range: [RelationshipType](RelationshipType.md) [required]
    * __Local__
 * [gene regulatory relationship.subject](gene_regulatory_relationship_subject.md)
    * Description: connects an association to the subject of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
