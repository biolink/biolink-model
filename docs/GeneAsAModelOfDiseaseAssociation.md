## Mappings

## Inheritance

 *  is_a: [GeneToDiseaseAssociation](GeneToDiseaseAssociation.md)
 *  mixin: [ModelToDiseaseMixin](ModelToDiseaseMixin.md) - This mixin is used for any association class for which the subject (source node) plays the role of a 'model', in that it recapitulates some features of the disease in a way that is useful for studying the disease outside a patient carrying the disease
 *  mixin: [EntityToDiseaseAssociation](EntityToDiseaseAssociation.md) - mixin class for any association whose object (target node) is a disease

## Fields

 * [gene as a model of disease association.subject](gene_as_a_model_of_disease_association_subject.md)
    * Description: A gene that has a role in modeling the disease. This may be a model organism ortholog of a known disease gene, or it may be a gene whose mutants recapitulate core features of the disease.
  
    * range: [GeneOrGeneProduct](GeneOrGeneProduct.md) [required]
    * __Local__
 * [association slot](association_slot.md)
    * Description: any slot that relates an association to another entity
    * range: **string**

    * Description: An IRI for the node. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.
    * range: [IriType](IriType.md)
    * inherited from: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
 * [name](name.md) *subsets*: (translator_minimal)
    * Description: A human-readable name for a thing
    * range: [LabelType](LabelType.md)

    * inherited from: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
 * [object](object.md)
    * Description: connects an association to the object of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
