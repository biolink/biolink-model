## Parents

 *  is_a: [Association](Association.md) - A typed association between two entities, supported by evidence

## Children

 * [AnatomicalEntityToAnatomicalEntityOntogenicAssociation](AnatomicalEntityToAnatomicalEntityOntogenicAssociation.md) - A relationship between two anatomical entities where the relationship is ontogenic, i.e the two entities are related by development. A number of different relationship types can be used to specify the precise nature of the relationship
 * [AnatomicalEntityToAnatomicalEntityPartOfAssociation](AnatomicalEntityToAnatomicalEntityPartOfAssociation.md) - A relationship between two anatomical entities where the relationship is mereological, i.e the two entities are related by parthood. This includes relationships between cellular components and cells, between cells and tissues, tissues and whole organisms
