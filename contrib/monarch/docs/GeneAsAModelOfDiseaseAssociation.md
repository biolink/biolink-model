## Mappings

## Inheritance

 *  is_a: [GeneToDiseaseAssociation](GeneToDiseaseAssociation.md)
 *  mixin: [ModelToDiseaseMixin](ModelToDiseaseMixin.md) - This mixin is used for any association class for which the subject (source node) plays the role of a 'model', in that it recapitulates some features of the disease in a way that is useful for studying the disease outside a patient carrying the disease
 *  mixin: [EntityToDiseaseAssociation](EntityToDiseaseAssociation.md) - mixin class for any association whose object (target node) is a disease
