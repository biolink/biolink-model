## Mappings

## Inheritance

 *  is_a: [Association](Association.md) - A typed association between two entities, supported by evidence
 *  mixin: [EntityToFeatureOrDiseaseQualifiers](EntityToFeatureOrDiseaseQualifiers.md) - Qualifiers for entity to disease or phenotype associations
## Children

 * [CaseToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation](CaseToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation.md) (mixin)  - An association between a case (e.g. individual patient) and a phenotypic feature in which the individual has or has had the phenotype
 * [DiseaseToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation](DiseaseToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation.md) (mixin)  - An association between a disease and a phenotypic feature in which the phenotypic feature is associated with the disease in some way
 * [EnvironmentToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation](EnvironmentToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation.md) (mixin)  - Any association between an environment and a phenotypic feature, where being in the environment influences the phenotype
 * [GeneToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation](GeneToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation.md) (mixin) 
 * [GenotypeToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation](GenotypeToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation.md) (mixin)  - Any association between one genotype and a phenotypic feature, where having the genotype confers the phenotype, either in isolation or through environment
 * [VariantToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation](VariantToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation.md) (mixin)
