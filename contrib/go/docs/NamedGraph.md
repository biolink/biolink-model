## Mappings

## Inheritance

 *  is_a: [InformationContentEntity](InformationContentEntity.md) - a piece of information that typically describes some piece of biology or is used as support.
## Children

 * [CausalActivityModel](CausalActivityModel.md) - A graph-based representation of how a collection of gene products operate together to achieve a biological objective. A GO-CAM model is a specialization of a named graph containing instances of GO molecular functions, entities, processes, cellular components etc, connected via causal relationships.
