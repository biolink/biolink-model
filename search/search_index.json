Biolink Model can be used to formalize the relationships between data structures in translational science. It incorporates object-oriented classification and graph-oriented features. The core of the model is a set of hierarchical, interconnected classes (or categories) and relationships between them (or predicates). The model provides class and edge attributes and associations that guide how entities should relate to one another. The goal of the Biolink Model is to provide a consistent framework for representing biological knowledge across various databases and formats.

Only one data source should be declared primary in any association.  \"aggregator knowledge source\" can be used to capture non-primary sources. publications One or more publications that report the statement expressed in an  Association, or provide information used as evidence supporting this statement. qualified_predicate Predicate to be used in an association when subject and object qualifiers are present and the full reading of the statement requires a qualification to the predicate in use in order to refine or  increase the specificity of the full statement reading.  This qualifier holds a relationship to be used instead of that  expressed by the primary predicate, in a \u2018full statement\u2019 reading of the association, where qualifier-based  semantics are included.  This is necessary only in cases where the primary predicate does not work in a  full statement reading. qualifier grouping slot for all qualifiers on an edge.  useful for testing compliance with association classes qualifiers connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning of that association quantifier_qualifier A measurable quantity for the object of the association reaction_balanced None reaction_direction the direction of a reaction as constrained by the direction enum (ie: left_to_right, neutral, etc.) reaction_side the side of a reaction being modeled (ie: left or right) relative_frequency_object The frequency at which subject and object concepts co-occur in  records within a dataset/cohort, relative to the frequency at which the object concept appears in these same records. relative_frequency_object_confidence_interval The 99% confidence interval for the relative_frequency_object calculation (i.e. the range of values within which the true value has a 99% chance of falling) relative_frequency_subject The frequency at which subject and object concepts co-occur in  records within a dataset/cohort, relative to the frequency at which the subject concept appears in these same records. relative_frequency_subject_confidence_interval The 99% confidence interval for the relative_frequency_subject calculation (i.e. the range of values within which the true value has a 99% chance of falling) semmed_agreement_count The number of times this concept has been asserted in the SemMedDB literature database. sequence_localization_attribute An attribute that can be applied to a genome sequence localization edge. These edges connect a nucleic acid entity such as an exon to an entity such as a chromosome. Edge properties are used to ascribe specific positional information and other metadata to the localization. In pragmatic terms this can be thought of as columns in a GFF3 line. sequence_variant_qualifier a qualifier used in an association with the variant severity_qualifier a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state how severe the phenotype is in the subject sex_qualifier a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state whether the association is specific to a particular sex. species_context_qualifier A statement qualifier representing a taxonomic category of species in which a relationship expressed in an association took place. stage_qualifier stage during which gene or protein expression of takes place. start_coordinate The position at which the subject genomic entity starts on the chromosome or other entity to which it is located on. (ie: the start of the sequence being referenced is 1). start_interbase_coordinate The position at which the subject nucleic acid entity starts on the chromosome or other entity to which it is located on. (ie: the start of the sequence being referenced is 0). statement_qualifier stoichiometry the relationship between the relative quantities of substances taking part in a reaction or forming a compound, typically a ratio of whole integers. strand The strand on which a feature is located. Has a value of '+' (sense strand or forward strand) or '-' (anti-sense strand or reverse strand). subject connects an association to the subject of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object. subject_aspect_qualifier None subject_category Used to hold the biolink class/category of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. subject_category_closure Used to hold the subject category closure of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. subject_closure Used to hold the subject closure of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. subject_context_qualifier None subject_derivative_qualifier None subject_direction_qualifier None subject_form_or_variant_qualifier None subject_label_closure Used to hold the subject label closure of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. subject_location_in_text Character offsets for the text span(s) in the supporting text corresponding to the subject concept of the extracted assertion. subject_namespace Used to hold the subject namespace of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. subject_part_qualifier None support_graphs A list of knowledge graphs that support the existence of this node. supporting_data_set A set of data used as evidence to generate the knowledge expressed in an Association (e.g. through computation on, reasoning or inference over the retrieved data). supporting_data_source An Information Resource from which data was retrieved and subsequently used as evidence to generate the knowledge expressed in an Association (e.g. through computation on, reasoning or inference over the retrieved data). supporting_document_type The document type (e.g., Journal Article, Case Study, Preprint) for the supporting document used in a Text Mining Result. supporting_document_year The document year (typically the publication year) for the supporting document used in a Text Mining Result. supporting_documents One or more referenceable documents that report the statement expressed in an Association, or provide  information used as evidence supporting this statement. supporting_study_cohort A description of a study population/cohort that was interrogated to provide evidence for the association  (e.g. the inclusion and exclusion criteria). supporting_study_context A term or terms describing the experimental setting/context in which evidence supporting the Association was  generated ('context' may be defined by many factors, including taxon, model system (e.g. cell line type), tissue  type, disease, etc.). supporting_study_date_range The date range over which data was collected in a study that provided evidence for an Association. supporting_study_metadata Information about a study used to generate information used as evidence to support the knowledge expressed in an  Association. In practice, data creators should use one of the more specific subtypes of this property. supporting_study_method_description A uri or curie pointing to information about the methodology used to generate data supporting an Association. supporting_study_method_type A type of method that was applied in a study used to generate the information used as evidence (e.g. a type of  experimental assay, or statistical calculation, or computational analysis). supporting_study_size The sample size used in a study that provided evidence for the association (e.g. 'n' of a cohort for a  clinical study). supporting_text The segment of text from a document that supports the mined assertion. supporting_text_section_type The section of the supporting text of a Text Mining Result within the supporting document. This is in the form of the name of the document section (e.g., Abstract, Introduction) that contains the supporting text. temporal_context_qualifier a constraint of time placed upon the truth value of an association. for time intervales, use temporal interval qualifier. temporal_interval_qualifier a constraint of a time interval placed upon the truth value of an association. total_sample_size The total number of patients or participants within a sample population."},{"location":"#enumerations","title":"Enumerations","text":"Enumeration Description CausalMechanismQualifierEnum None ChemicalEntityDerivativeEnum None ChemicalOrGeneOrGeneProductFormOrVariantEnum None ClinicalApprovalStatusEnum None DirectionQualifierEnum None DrugAvailabilityEnum DrugDeliveryEnum None DruggableGeneCategoryEnum None FDAIDAAdverseEventEnum please consult with the FDA guidelines as proposed in this document: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=312.32 GeneOrGeneProductOrChemicalEntityAspectEnum None GeneOrGeneProductOrChemicalPartQualifierEnum None LogicalInterpretationEnum None MaxResearchPhaseEnum None PhaseEnum phase ReactionDirectionEnum None ReactionSideEnum None ResourceRoleEnum The role played by the information reource in serving as a source for an edge in a TRAPI message.

Publication summary 0..1  String executive  summary of a publication Publication keywords 0..*  String keywords tagging a publication Publication mesh_terms 0..*  Uriorcurie mesh terms tagging a publication Publication xref 0..*  Uriorcurie A database cross reference or alternative identifier for a NamedThing or edge between two  NamedThings.  This property should point to a database record or webpage that supports the existence of the edge, or  gives more detail about the edge. This property can be used on a node or edge to provide multiple URIs or CURIE cross references. Publication, NamedThing license 0..1  String None InformationContentEntity rights 0..1  String None InformationContentEntity format 0..1  String None InformationContentEntity creation_date 0..1  Date date on which an entity was created. This can be applied to nodes or edges InformationContentEntity provided_by 0..*  String The value in this node property represents the knowledge provider that created or assembled the node and all of its attributes.  Used internally to represent how a particular node made its way into a knowledge provider or graph. NamedThing full_name 0..1  LabelType a long-form human readable name for a thing NamedThing synonym 0..*  LabelType Alternate human-readable names for a thing NamedThing id 1..1  String Different kinds of publication subtypes will have different preferred identifiers (curies when feasible). Precedence of identifiers for scientific articles is as follows: PMID if available; DOI if not; actual alternate CURIE otherwise. Enclosing publications (i.e. referenced by 'published in' node property) such as books and journals, should have industry-standard identifier such as from ISBN and ISSN. Entity iri 0..1  IriType An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules. Entity category 1..*  CategoryType Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.  In an RDF database  it should be a biolink model class URI. This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the  biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values <code>biolink:Protein</code>,  <code>biolink:GeneProduct</code>, <code>biolink:MolecularEntity</code>. In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type  triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something  in biolink. For example, a sequence feature <code>f</code> may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing} Entity type 0..*  String None Entity name 0..1  LabelType the 'title' of the publication is generally recorded in the 'name' property (inherited from NamedThing). The field name 'title' is now also tagged as an acceptable alias for the node property 'name' (just in case).

For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object. Association predicate 1..1  PredicateType A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate. This is analogous to category for nodes. Association object 1..1  DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature disease or phenotype Association negated 0..1  Boolean if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true Association qualifiers 0..*  OntologyClass connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning of that association Association publications 0..*  Publication One or more publications that report the statement expressed in an  Association, or provide information used as evidence supporting this statement. Association has_evidence 0..*  EvidenceType connects an association to an instance of supporting evidence Association knowledge_source 0..1  String An Information Resource from which the knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved, directly or indirectly. This can be any resource through which the knowledge passed on its way to its currently serialized form. In practice, implementers should use one of the more specific subtypes of this generic property. Association primary_knowledge_source 0..1  String The most upstream source of the knowledge expressed in an Association that an implementer can identify.  Performing a rigorous analysis of upstream data providers is expected; every effort is made to catalog the most upstream source of data in this property.  Only one data source should be declared primary in any association.  \"aggregator knowledge source\" can be used to capture non-primary sources. Association aggregator_knowledge_source 0..*  String An intermediate aggregator resource from which knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved downstream of the original source, on its path to its current serialized form. Association timepoint 0..1  TimeType a point in time Association original_subject 0..1  String used to hold the original subject of a relation (or predicate) that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification. Association original_predicate 0..1  Uriorcurie used to hold the original relation/predicate that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification. Association original_object 0..1  String used to hold the original object of a relation (or predicate) that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification. Association subject_category 0..1  OntologyClass Used to hold the biolink class/category of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association object_category 0..1  OntologyClass Used to hold the biolink class/category of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association subject_closure 0..*  String Used to hold the subject closure of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association object_closure 0..*  String Used to hold the object closure of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX.

This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association object_category_closure 0..*  OntologyClass Used to hold the object category closure of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association subject_namespace 0..1  String Used to hold the subject namespace of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association object_namespace 0..1  String Used to hold the object namespace of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association subject_label_closure 0..*  String Used to hold the subject label closure of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association object_label_closure 0..*  String Used to hold the object label closure of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association retrieval_source_ids 0..*  RetrievalSource A list of retrieval sources that served as a source of knowledge expressed in an Edge, or a source of data used to generate this knowledge. Association id 1..1  String A unique identifier for an entity. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI Entity iri 0..1  IriType An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules. Entity category 0..*  CategoryType Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.  In an RDF database  it should be a biolink model class URI.

AKA minimal predicate. This is analogous to category for nodes. Association object 1..1  NamedThing connects an association to the object of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object. Association negated 0..1  Boolean if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true Association qualifiers 0..*  OntologyClass connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning of that association Association publications 0..*  Publication One or more publications that report the statement expressed in an  Association, or provide information used as evidence supporting this statement. Association has_evidence 0..*  EvidenceType connects an association to an instance of supporting evidence Association knowledge_source 0..1  String An Information Resource from which the knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved, directly or indirectly. This can be any resource through which the knowledge passed on its way to its currently serialized form. In practice, implementers should use one of the more specific subtypes of this generic property. Association primary_knowledge_source 0..1  String The most upstream source of the knowledge expressed in an Association that an implementer can identify.  Performing a rigorous analysis of upstream data providers is expected; every effort is made to catalog the most upstream source of data in this property.  Only one data source should be declared primary in any association.  \"aggregator knowledge source\" can be used to capture non-primary sources. Association aggregator_knowledge_source 0..*  String An intermediate aggregator resource from which knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved downstream of the original source, on its path to its current serialized form. Association timepoint 0..1  TimeType a point in time Association original_subject 0..1  String used to hold the original subject of a relation (or predicate) that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification.

Association original_object 0..1  String used to hold the original object of a relation (or predicate) that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification. Association subject_category 0..1  OntologyClass Used to hold the biolink class/category of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association object_category 0..1  OntologyClass Used to hold the biolink class/category of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association subject_closure 0..*  String Used to hold the subject closure of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association object_closure 0..*  String Used to hold the object closure of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX.

This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association retrieval_source_ids 0..*  RetrievalSource A list of retrieval sources that served as a source of knowledge expressed in an Edge, or a source of data used to generate this knowledge. Association id 1..1  String A unique identifier for an entity. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI Entity iri 0..1  IriType An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules. Entity category 0..*  CategoryType Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.  In an RDF database  it should be a biolink model class URI. This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the  biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values <code>biolink:Protein</code>,  <code>biolink:GeneProduct</code>, <code>biolink:MolecularEntity</code>. In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type  triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something  in biolink. For example, a sequence feature <code>f</code> may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing} Entity type 0..*  String rdf:type of biolink:Association should be fixed at rdf:Statement Entity name 0..1  LabelType A human-readable name for an attribute or entity.

EntityToPhenotypicFeatureAssociationMixin subject 1..1  GeneOrGeneProduct A gene that has a role in modeling the disease. This may be a model organism ortholog of a known disease gene, or it may be a gene whose mutants recapitulate core features of the disease. Association predicate 1..1  PredicateType A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate. This is analogous to category for nodes. Association object 1..1  Disease disease Association negated 0..1  Boolean if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true Association qualifiers 0..*  OntologyClass connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning of that association Association publications 0..*  Publication One or more publications that report the statement expressed in an  Association, or provide information used as evidence supporting this statement. Association has_evidence 0..*  EvidenceType connects an association to an instance of supporting evidence Association knowledge_source 0..1  String An Information Resource from which the knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved, directly or indirectly. This can be any resource through which the knowledge passed on its way to its currently serialized form. In practice, implementers should use one of the more specific subtypes of this generic property. Association primary_knowledge_source 0..1  String The most upstream source of the knowledge expressed in an Association that an implementer can identify.  Performing a rigorous analysis of upstream data providers is expected; every effort is made to catalog the most upstream source of data in this property.  Only one data source should be declared primary in any association.  \"aggregator knowledge source\" can be used to capture non-primary sources. Association aggregator_knowledge_source 0..*  String An intermediate aggregator resource from which knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved downstream of the original source, on its path to its current serialized form. Association timepoint 0..1  TimeType a point in time Association original_subject 0..1  String used to hold the original subject of a relation (or predicate) that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification. Association original_predicate 0..1  Uriorcurie used to hold the original relation/predicate that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification. Association original_object 0..1  String used to hold the original object of a relation (or predicate) that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification. Association subject_category 0..1  OntologyClass Used to hold the biolink class/category of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association object_category 0..1  OntologyClass Used to hold the biolink class/category of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association subject_closure 0..*  String Used to hold the subject closure of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association object_closure 0..*  String Used to hold the object closure of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX.

This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association object_namespace 0..1  String Used to hold the object namespace of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association subject_label_closure 0..*  String Used to hold the subject label closure of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association object_label_closure 0..*  String Used to hold the object label closure of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association retrieval_source_ids 0..*  RetrievalSource A list of retrieval sources that served as a source of knowledge expressed in an Edge, or a source of data used to generate this knowledge. Association id 1..1  String A unique identifier for an entity. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI Entity iri 0..1  IriType An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules. Entity category 0..*  CategoryType Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.  In an RDF database  it should be a biolink model class URI. This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the  biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values <code>biolink:Protein</code>,  <code>biolink:GeneProduct</code>, <code>biolink:MolecularEntity</code>. In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type  triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something  in biolink. For example, a sequence feature <code>f</code> may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing} Entity type 0..*  String rdf:type of biolink:Association should be fixed at rdf:Statement Entity name 0..1  LabelType A human-readable name for an attribute or entity.

Genotype An information content entity that describes a genome by specifying the total variation in genomic sequence and/or gene expression, relative to some established background InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation association between a named thing and a information content entity where the specific context of the relationship between that named thing and the publication is unknown. For example, model organisms databases often capture the knowledge that a gene is found in a journal article, but not specifically the context in which that gene was documented in the article. In these cases, this association with the accompanying predicate 'mentions' could be used. Conversely, for more specific associations (like 'gene to disease association', the publication should be captured as an edge property). LifeStage A stage of development or growth of an organism, including post-natal adult stages MacromolecularComplex A stable assembly of two or more macromolecules, i.e. proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates or lipids, in which at least one component is a protein and the constituent parts function together. MicroRNA None NucleicAcidEntity A nucleic acid entity is a molecular entity characterized by availability in gene databases of nucleotide-based sequence representations of its precise sequence; for convenience of representation, partial sequences of various kinds are included. OrganismTaxon A classification of a set of organisms. Example instances: NCBITaxon:9606 (Homo sapiens), NCBITaxon:2 (Bacteria). Can also be used to represent strains or subspecies. PhenotypicFeature A combination of entity and quality that makes up a phenotyping statement. An observable characteristic of an  individual resulting from the interaction of its genotype with its molecular and physical environment. Polypeptide A polypeptide is a molecular entity characterized by availability in protein databases of amino-acid-based sequence representations of its precise primary structure; for convenience of representation, partial sequences of various kinds are included, even if they do not represent a physical molecule. PopulationOfIndividualOrganisms A collection of individuals from the same taxonomic class distinguished by one or more characteristics.  Characteristics can include, but are not limited to, shared geographic location, genetics, phenotypes. Publication Any \u2018published\u2019 piece of information. Publications are considered broadly  to include any document or document part made available in print or on the  web - which may include scientific journal issues, individual articles, and  books - as well as things like pre-prints, white papers, patents, drug  labels, web pages, protocol documents,  and even a part of a publication if  of significant knowledge scope (e.g. a figure, figure legend, or section  highlighted by NLP). ReagentTargetedGene A gene altered in its expression level in the context of some experiment as a result of being targeted by gene-knockdown reagent(s) such as a morpholino or RNAi. SequenceVariant A sequence_variant is a non exact copy of a sequence_feature or genome exhibiting one or more sequence_alteration. Serial This class may rarely be instantiated except if use cases of a given knowledge graph support its utility. SiRNA A small RNA molecule that is the product of a longer exogenous or endogenous dsRNA, which is either a bimolecular duplex or very long hairpin, processed (via the Dicer pathway) such that numerous siRNAs accumulate from both strands of the dsRNA. SRNAs trigger the cleavage of their target molecules. SmallMolecule A small molecule entity is a molecular entity characterized by availability in small-molecule databases of SMILES, InChI, IUPAC, or other unambiguous representation of its precise chemical structure; for convenience of representation, any valid chemical representation is included, even if it is not strictly molecular (e.g., sodium ion).

association to the subject of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object. Association predicate 1..1  PredicateType A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate. This is analogous to category for nodes. Association object 1..1  NamedThing connects an association to the object of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object. Association negated 0..1  Boolean if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true Association qualifiers 0..*  OntologyClass connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning of that association Association publications 0..*  Publication One or more publications that report the statement expressed in an  Association, or provide information used as evidence supporting this statement. Association has_evidence 0..*  EvidenceType connects an association to an instance of supporting evidence Association knowledge_source 0..1  String An Information Resource from which the knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved, directly or indirectly. This can be any resource through which the knowledge passed on its way to its currently serialized form. In practice, implementers should use one of the more specific subtypes of this generic property. Association primary_knowledge_source 0..1  String The most upstream source of the knowledge expressed in an Association that an implementer can identify.  Performing a rigorous analysis of upstream data providers is expected; every effort is made to catalog the most upstream source of data in this property.  Only one data source should be declared primary in any association.  \"aggregator knowledge source\" can be used to capture non-primary sources. Association aggregator_knowledge_source 0..*  String An intermediate aggregator resource from which knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved downstream of the original source, on its path to its current serialized form. Association timepoint 0..1  TimeType a point in time Association original_subject 0..1  String used to hold the original subject of a relation (or predicate) that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification. Association original_predicate 0..1  Uriorcurie used to hold the original relation/predicate that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification.

Association subject_category 0..1  OntologyClass Used to hold the biolink class/category of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association object_category 0..1  OntologyClass Used to hold the biolink class/category of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association subject_closure 0..*  String Used to hold the subject closure of an association.

Association object_label_closure 0..*  String Used to hold the object label closure of an association. This is a denormalized  field used primarily in the SQL serialization of a knowledge graph via KGX. Association retrieval_source_ids 0..*  RetrievalSource A list of retrieval sources that served as a source of knowledge expressed in an Edge, or a source of data used to generate this knowledge. Association id 1..1  String A unique identifier for an entity. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI Entity iri 0..1  IriType An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules. Entity category 0..*  CategoryType Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.  In an RDF database  it should be a biolink model class URI. This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the  biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values <code>biolink:Protein</code>,  <code>biolink:GeneProduct</code>, <code>biolink:MolecularEntity</code>. In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type  triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something  in biolink. For example, a sequence feature <code>f</code> may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing} Entity type 0..*  String rdf:type of biolink:Association should be fixed at rdf:Statement Entity name 0..1  LabelType A human-readable name for an attribute or entity.

Publication pages 0..*  String When a 2-tuple of page numbers are provided, they represent the start and end page of the publication within its parent publication context. For books, this may be set to the total number of pages of the book. Publication summary 0..1  String executive  summary of a publication Publication keywords 0..*  String keywords tagging a publication Publication mesh_terms 0..*  Uriorcurie mesh terms tagging a publication Publication xref 0..*  Uriorcurie A database cross reference or alternative identifier for a NamedThing or edge between two  NamedThings.  This property should point to a database record or webpage that supports the existence of the edge, or  gives more detail about the edge. This property can be used on a node or edge to provide multiple URIs or CURIE cross references. Publication, NamedThing license 0..1  String None InformationContentEntity rights 0..1  String None InformationContentEntity format 0..1  String None InformationContentEntity creation_date 0..1  Date date on which an entity was created.

Used internally to represent how a particular node made its way into a knowledge provider or graph. NamedThing full_name 0..1  LabelType a long-form human readable name for a thing NamedThing synonym 0..*  LabelType Alternate human-readable names for a thing NamedThing id 1..1  String Different kinds of publication subtypes will have different preferred identifiers (curies when feasible). Precedence of identifiers for scientific articles is as follows: PMID if available; DOI if not; actual alternate CURIE otherwise. Enclosing publications (i.e. referenced by 'published in' node property) such as books and journals, should have industry-standard identifier such as from ISBN and ISSN. Entity iri 0..1  IriType An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules. Entity category 1..*  CategoryType Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.  In an RDF database  it should be a biolink model class URI. This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the  biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values <code>biolink:Protein</code>,  <code>biolink:GeneProduct</code>, <code>biolink:MolecularEntity</code>. In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type  triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something  in biolink. For example, a sequence feature <code>f</code> may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink.

The core of the model is a set of hierarchical, interconnected classes (or categories) and relationships between them (or predicates). The model provides class and edge attributes and associations that guide how entities should relate to one another.

This is preferred over minting new ontology  terms at a more granular level than is practical, or using structured data objects as Statement subject/objects.</li> <li>The \u2018core triple\u2019 should remain true if qualifiers are ignored: When using qualifiers, ensure that the core SPO triple remains true when qualifiers are ignored. (However, note that there may be one predicate used for the core triple and a  different predicate for the qualified assertion.) If certain necessary qualifiers may violate this rule (e.g., \u2018negated\u2019),  these should be flagged and NEVER ignored.</li> <li>Control predicate proliferation: When deciding where to place Statement semantics, choose modeling approaches that  avoid a potential for an explosion of predicates. Pushing semantics into qualifiers is one way to achieve this.</li> <li>Represent information consistently: Where possible, a given type of semantics (e.g., gene aspect, direction of effect)  should be represented using the same pattern across Statement types and components.  This will facilitate clear and  consistent creation of data, and simplify query construction and answering.</li> </ul> <p>As an example, let's consider the definition of class  <code>chemical affects gene association</code>:</p> <pre><code>  chemical affects gene association:\n    description: &gt;-\n      Describes an effect that a chemical has on a gene or gene product (e.g. an impact of on its abundance, activity,\n      localization, processing, expression, etc.)\n    is_a: association\n    slots:\n      - subject form or variant qualifier\n      - subject part qualifier\n      - subject derivative qualifier\n      - subject aspect qualifier\n      - subject context qualifier\n      - subject direction qualifier\n      - object form or variant qualifier\n      - object part qualifier\n      - object aspect qualifier\n      - object context qualifier\n      - causal mechanism qualifier\n      - anatomical context qualifier\n      - qualified predicate\n    slot_usage:\n      subject:\n        range: chemical entity\n      subject form or variant qualifier:\n        range: chemical_or_gene_or_gene_product_form_or_variant_enum\n      subject part qualifier:\n        range: gene_or_gene_product_or_chemical_part_qualifier_enum\n      subject derivative qualifier:\n        range: chemical_entity_derivative_enum\n      subject aspect qualifier:\n        range: gene_or_gene_product_or_chemical_entity_aspect_enum\n      subject context qualifier:\n        range: anatomical entity\n      subject direction qualifier:\n        range: direction_qualifier_enum\n      predicate:\n        subproperty_of: affects\n      qualified predicate:\n        subproperty_of: causes\n      object:\n        range: gene or gene product\n      object form or variant qualifier:\n        range: chemical_or_gene_or_gene_product_form_or_variant_enum\n      object part qualifier:\n        range: gene_or_gene_product_or_chemical_part_qualifier_enum\n      object aspect qualifier:\n        range: gene_or_gene_product_or_chemical_entity_aspect_enum\n      object context qualifier:\n        range: anatomical entity\n      object direction qualifier:\n        range: direction_qualifier_enum\n      causal mechanism qualifier:\n        range: causal_mechanism_qualifier_enum\n      anatomical context qualifier:\n        range: anatomical entity\n      species context qualifier:\n        range: organism taxon\n</code></pre> <p>In the above YAML snippet, we first define the class <code>chemical affects gene association</code> as a subclass of <code>association</code>  and then we define the slots that this class will have.  Many of these slots represent qualifiers that are used to  refine the meaning of the association. For example, <code>object form or variant qualifier</code> is a slot that is used to describe when a \"mutant form\" of a gene is used in an assertion.  This allows us to both represent that the gene of interest (the object) is somehow related to the chemical of interest (the subject), and also that more specifically we may be talking about a \"mutant form\" of the gene.  \"mutant form\" is a <code>biolink:object_form_or_variant_qualifier</code>.  This  kind of modeling allows us to increase connectivity in graphs by using a core biological concept (gene) but also be more specific and nuanced about the meaning of the association by qualifying the concept (gene) with a more specific form of \"mutant form\" of that concept. </p> <p>We find the diagram below to be a helpful visualization of an association class and its components. </p> <p>For more information on qualifiers, please refer to Reading a Qualifier Based Statement</p> <p>For more information on what each slot means and how to use them in Biolink Model, refer to Using the Modeling Language.</p>"},{"location":"curating-the-model/#adding-a-predicate","title":"Adding a predicate","text":"<p>A predicate is a slot that links two instances of a class. </p> <p>To add a predicate to Biolink Model you need to determine the following:   - What is an appropriate name for this predicate?

Of course, jargon is hard to define. We encourage contributors to use their best judgement here, but expect that there are a wide variety of people using and interacting with Biolink Model.  Our language here should be interpretable by people with many different expertises.  Examples are the key to good PRs.</li> <li>Team members  adding new modeling bear the responsibility of re-using existing elements or demonstrating to the team  how their proposed alternative modeling is generally superior. This can be simplified by keeping pull requests small.  Diligent modeling efforts should be acknowledged, especially for newer contributors.

The model serves a central role in the Translator program and forms the architectural basis of the Translator system,  as described below. </p> <p>The Translator program aims to develop a comprehensive, relational, N-dimensional infrastructure designed to integrate disparate data  sources\u2014including objective signs and symptoms of disease, drug effects, chemical and genetic interactions, cell and organ pathology,  and other relevant biological entities and relations\u2014and reason over the integrated data to rapidly derive biomedical insights.  The ultimate goal of Translator is to augment human reasoning and thereby accelerate translational science and knowledge discovery. </p> <p>To achieve its ambitious goal, the Translator project assembled a diverse interdisciplinary team and a variety of biomedical data  sources, including electronic health record data, clinical trial data, genomic and other -omics data, chemical reaction data, and  drug data. There are hundreds of data sources in the Translator ecosystem, each of which had its own data representation and were  in formats that were not compatible or interoperable. Moreover, groups within the Translator Consortium had integrated the data  sources as knowledge sources within independent KGs, but these KGs were developed using different technologies and formalisms  such as property graphs in Neo4j and semantically-linked data via RDF and OWL. </p> <p>In order to interoperate between knowledge sources and reason across KGs, Biolink Model was adopted as the common dialect, thus  enabling queries over the entire Translator KG ecosystem. The result was a federated, harmonized ecosystem that supports advanced  reasoning and inference to derive biomedical insights based on user queries.</p> <p>An example Translator use case involved a collaboration with investigators at the Hugh Kaul Precision Medicine Institute (PMI) at  the University of Alabama at Birmingham. PMI investigators posed the following natural-language question to the Translator Consortium:  what chemicals or drugs might be used to treat neurological disorders such as epilepsy that are associated with genomic  variants of RHOBTB2? The investigators noted that RHOBTB2 variants cause an accumulation of RHOBTB2 protein and that this  accumulation is believed to be the cause of the neurological disorder. </p> <p>To answer the PMI investigator\u2019s question, Translator team members structured the following query: </p> <p>NCBIGene:23221 (CURIE for RHOBTB2) -&gt; [biolink:entity_regulates_entity, biolink:genetically_interacts_with] -&gt; biolink:Protein,  biolink:Gene -&gt; [biolink:related_to] -&gt; biolink:SmallMolecule</p> <p>(see Figure 2 below). Because of the hierarchical structure of the Biolink model, the use of biolink:related_to also will return more specific predicates such as biolink:negatively_regulates and biolink:positively_regulates.  The objective was to identify drugs or chemicals that might regulate RHOBTB2 in some manner and thereby reduce the variant-induced  accumulation of RHOBTB2 and associated neurological symptoms. As all nodes and edges within the Translator KG ecosystem are  annotated to Biolink Model classes and attributes, a Translator query can be constructed from a natural-language user question  and return results across a multitude of independent data sources. In addition, because the model employs hierarchical classes,  with inheritance and polymorphism, natural-language queries translated to graph queries using Biolink Model syntax can be  constructed at varying levels of granularity and return results from all levels of the hierarchy. Finally, because Biolink  Model provides attributes on both edges and nodes that record provenance and evidence for these knowledge statements, each  result is annotated with the trail of evidence that supports it.</p> <p>When Translator team members sent the query to the Translator system, it returned several candidates of interest to PMI investigators,  including fostamatinib disodium (CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL3989516) and ruxolitinib (CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1789941).  A review of the supporting evidence provided by Translator indicates that these are approved drugs that either directly or  indirectly reduce or otherwise regulate the expression of RHOBTB2. Thus, Biolink Model helped Translator teams bring data  together into a single system, thereby reducing the burden on the user to find and manually assemble data from these independent resources  (see citation below).</p> <p> Figure 2. An overview of the Translator architecture that supports biomedical KG-based question-answering, including the  role of Biolink Model, in the context of an example question. In this example, a user has posed the natural-language question:  what chemicals or drugs might be used to treat neurological disorders such as epilepsy that are associated with genomic variants of  RHOBTB2? The question is translated into a graph query, as shown in the top left panel, which is then translated into a  Translator standard machine query (not shown). The KG shown in the second panel from the left is derived from a variety of diverse \u2018knowledge sources\u2019, a subset of which are displayed in the figure, that are exposed by Translator \u2018knowledge providers\u2019.  Biolink Model provides standardization and semantic harmonization across the disparate knowledge sources, thereby allowing  them to be integrated into a KG capable of supporting question-answering. In this example, Translator provided two answers or  results of interest to the investigative team that posed the question, namely, fostamatinib disodium and ruxolitinib, as shown  in the bottom left panel. </p>"},{"location":"faq/#citing-biolink-model","title":"Citing Biolink Model","text":"<p>Unni DR, Moxon SAT, Bada M, Brush M, Bruskiewich R, Caufield JH, Clemons PA, Dancik V, Dumontier M, Fecho K, Glusman G,  Hadlock JJ, Harris NL, Joshi A, Putman T, Qin G, Ramsey SA, Shefchek KA, Solbrig H, Soman K, Thessen AE, Haendel MA,  Bizon C, Mungall CJ, The Biomedical Data Translator Consortium (2022).

how to \u2018read\u2019 the meaning of an Association Statement by composing the semantics encoded in its SPOQ slots.  Note that many such Associations will consist only of a subject-predicate-object triple - in which case a reading of the statement expressed is straight-forward.  When qualifiers are included, this introduces a second level of meaning that complements the statement made by the core SPO triple. This idea that there can be two related statements at two levels of granularity encoded in a single Association is a critical idea behind the qualifier-based approach: The first level is the Core Triple Reading of the Association, which considers only the subject, predicate, and object slots.  This reading must be clear and true. The second level is the Full Statement Reading of the Association, which considers the semantics added by qualifier slots (subject/object qualifiers, and statement qualifiers).  This reading must also be clear and true as well (which often requires use of a qualified_predicate).  Note that the Full Statement Reading provides additional detail or context for the claim made in the core triple.

In RDF sense, an association is an <code>rdf:Statement</code>. In a graph formalism, associations are represented using edges in a graph.</p> <p>Associations help us to make assertions about the world. For example, we can say that a gene is associated with a disease.  Or we can say that a gene is a member of a pathway.  Associations also help us constrain the meaning of an edge, or  add context to the edge that describes how or when the edge takes place.  In fact, we also use association objects to hold references to the publications, confidence scores, and other metadata that we use to support our assertions.</p> <p>Associations are arranged in a hierarchy where the root of all Associations is the <code>association</code> class.  In general,  Associations have three main properties (or slots):   * <code>subject</code>: the subject of the association   * <code>predicate</code>: the predicate or relationship between the subject and the object of the association   * <code>object</code>: the object of the association These three properties (or slots) define what Biolink calls a \"core triple\".</p> <p>Subjects and objects are always classes in the Biolink Model that are descendants of \"biolink:NamedThing\" and  represent core biological, chemical, and biomedical concepts (e.g. genes, diseases, chemicals, phenotypes),  whose IRIs come from community standard ontologies (e.g. HGNC, MONDO, ChEBI, HPO).  As a best practice,  Biolink Model prioritizes connectivity and practicality. </p> <p>The predicate in an Association is always a Biolink property (or slot) that is or descends from the \"biolink:related_to\"  property.  Predicates in Biolink often are exactly equivalent to relations in the Relations Ontology.  </p> <p>To express more complex or nuanced Statements, we use additional slots called qualifiers that  refine or extend the  meaning of the core triple. At the highest level we distinguish two kinds of qualifiers: (1) node qualifiers altering  the meaning of the Association subject or object specifically; (2) statement qualifiers refine or extend the meaning  of the statement as a whole. </p> <p>Together, the subject, predicate, object, and optional qualifier(s) comprise the full semantics of the statement that  an Association puts forth as true (i.e. its \u2018S-P-O-Q\u2019 semantics).  Association objects may also include slots to  hold additional metadata about this core statement - primarily information about the provenance and evidence supporting it.  Using these elements together we can build Associations with many possible \u2018layers\u2019 of complexity (Figure 1).  Some Associations may simply consist of an S-P-O triple. Others may represent more complex statements that employ  multiple qualifiers, supported by rich evidence and provenance metadata. For example, Figure 2 provides a layered  view of a complex Disease to Phenotype Association instance. </p> <p>Figure 1: A layered view of a simple a Biolink Association object. )</p> <p>Figure 2: An Association representing the Statement that \u201cLate Stage Ebola has phenotype Severe Bleeding with 92% penetrance in adults\u201d, and some provenance metadata supporting this. This representation leans heavily on qualifiers  for representing Statement semantics. </p> <p></p> <p>At the highest level we distinguish two kinds of qualifiers that contribute to an Association Statement:  * node qualifiers (aka subject / object qualifiers) extend or refine the meaning of an Association subject or object concept; * statement qualifiers refine or extend the meaning of the core S-P-O triple as a whole.</p> <p>Together, the subject, predicate, object, and optional qualifier(s) comprise the full semantics of the statement that an  Association puts forth as true (i.e. its \u2018S-P-O-Q\u2019 semantics).
