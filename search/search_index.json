Biolink Model can be used to formalize the relationships between data structures in translational science. It incorporates object-oriented classification and graph-oriented features. The core of the model is a set of hierarchical, interconnected classes (or categories) and relationships between them (or predicates). The model provides class and edge attributes and associations that guide how entities should relate to one another. The goal of the Biolink Model is to provide a consistent framework for representing biological knowledge across various databases and formats.

Interbase coordinates start at position 0 instead of position 1. This is applied to a sequence localization edge. knowledge_source An Information Resource from which the knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved, directly or indirectly. This can be any resource through which the knowledge passed on its way to its currently serialized form. In practice, implementers should use one of the more specific subtypes of this generic property. ln_ratio the natural log of the ratio of co-occurrence to expected ln_ratio_confidence_interval The 99% confidence interval for the ln_ratio calculation (i.e. the range of values within which the true value has a 99% chance of falling) log_odds_ratio The logarithm of the odds ratio, or the ratio of the odds of event Y occurring in an exposed group versus the odds of event Y occurring in a non-exposed group. log_odds_ratio_95_ci The ninety-five percent confidence range in which the true log odds ratio for the sample population falls. logical_interpretation None max_research_phase None mechanism_of_action a boolean flag to indicate if the edge is part of a path or subgraph of a knowledge graph that constitutes the mechanism of action for a result. negated if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true object connects an association to the object of the association.

For healthy tissues, use XXX. population_context_qualifier a biological population (general, study, cohort, etc.) with a specific set of characteristics to constrain an association. predicate A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate. This is analogous to category for nodes. primary_knowledge_source The most upstream source of the knowledge expressed in an Association that an implementer can identify.

This qualifier holds a relationship to be used instead of that expressed by the primary predicate, in a \u2018full statement\u2019 reading of the association, where qualifier-based semantics are included.  This is necessary only in cases where the primary predicate does not work in a full statement reading. qualifier grouping slot for all qualifiers on an edge.  useful for testing compliance with association classes qualifiers connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning of that association quantifier_qualifier A measurable quantity for the object of the association reaction_balanced None reaction_direction the direction of a reaction as constrained by the direction enum (ie: left_to_right, neutral, etc.) reaction_side the side of a reaction being modeled (ie: left or right) relative_frequency_object The frequency at which subject and object concepts co-occur in records within a dataset/cohort, relative to the frequency at which the object concept appears in these same records. relative_frequency_object_confidence_interval The 99% confidence interval for the relative_frequency_object calculation (i.e. the range of values within which the true value has a 99% chance of falling) relative_frequency_subject The frequency at which subject and object concepts co-occur in records within a dataset/cohort, relative to the frequency at which the subject concept appears in these same records. relative_frequency_subject_confidence_interval The 99% confidence interval for the relative_frequency_subject calculation (i.e. the range of values within which the true value has a 99% chance of falling) semmed_agreement_count The number of times this concept has been asserted in the SemMedDB literature database. sequence_localization_attribute An attribute that can be applied to a genome sequence localization edge. These edges connect a nucleic acid entity such as an exon to an entity such as a chromosome. Edge properties are used to ascribe specific positional information and other metadata to the localization. In pragmatic terms this can be thought of as columns in a GFF3 line. sequence_variant_qualifier a qualifier used in an association with the variant severity_qualifier a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state how severe the phenotype is in the subject sex_qualifier a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state whether the association is specific to a particular sex. species_context_qualifier A statement qualifier representing a taxonomic category of species in which a relationship expressed in an association took place. stage_qualifier stage during which gene or protein expression of takes place. start_coordinate The position at which the subject genomic entity starts on the chromosome or other entity to which it is located on.

Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI  1..1  String Entity iri:   An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.  0..1  IriType Entity category:   Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag. In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI. This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values <code>biolink:Protein</code>, <code>biolink:GeneProduct</code>, <code>biolink:MolecularEntity</code>. In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature <code>f</code> may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing}  0..*  CategoryType Entity type:   rdf:type of biolink:Association should be fixed at rdf:Statement  0..*  String Entity name:   A human-readable name for an attribute or entity.  0..1  LabelType Entity description:   a human-readable description of an entity  0..1  NarrativeText Entity

This qualifier specifies a change in the subject of an association (aka: statement).  0..1  ChemicalOrGeneOrGeneProductFormOrVariantEnum direct subject_part_qualifier:   defines a specific part/component of the core concept (used in cases there this specific part has no IRI we can use to directly represent it, e.g. 'ESR1 transcript' q: polyA tail).  This qualifier is for the  subject of an association (or statement).  0..1  GeneOrGeneProductOrChemicalPartQualifierEnum direct subject_derivative_qualifier:   A qualifier that composes with a core subject/object  concept to describe something that is derived from the core concept.  For example, the qualifier \u2018metabolite\u2019 combines with a \u2018Chemical X\u2019 core concept to express the composed concept \u2018a metabolite of Chemical X\u2019.

This qualifier holds a relationship to be used instead of that expressed by the primary predicate, in a \u2018full statement\u2019 reading of the association, where qualifier-based semantics are included.  This is necessary only in cases where the primary predicate does not work in a full statement reading.  0..1  String direct species_context_qualifier:   A statement qualifier representing a taxonomic category of species in which a relationship expressed in an association took place.  0..1  OrganismTaxon direct subject:   connects an association to the subject of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.  1..1  ChemicalEntity Association predicate:   A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate. This is analogous to category for nodes.  1..1  PredicateType Association object:   connects an association to the object of the association.

In practice, implementers should use one of the more specific subtypes of this generic property.  0..1  String Association primary_knowledge_source:   The most upstream source of the knowledge expressed in an Association that an implementer can identify.  Performing a rigorous analysis of upstream data providers is expected; every effort is made to catalog the most upstream source of data in this property.  Only one data source should be declared primary in any association.  \"aggregator knowledge source\" can be used to capture non-primary sources.  0..1  String Association aggregator_knowledge_source:   An intermediate aggregator resource from which knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved downstream of the original source, on its path to its current serialized form.  0..*  String Association timepoint:   a point in time  0..1  TimeType Association original_subject:   used to hold the original subject of a relation (or predicate) that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification.  0..1  String Association original_predicate:   used to hold the original relation/predicate that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification.  0..1  Uriorcurie Association original_object:   used to hold the original object of a relation (or predicate) that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification.  0..1  String Association subject_category:   Used to hold the biolink class/category of an association.

This is determined by the id using expansion rules.  0..1  IriType Entity category:   Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag. In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI. This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values <code>biolink:Protein</code>, <code>biolink:GeneProduct</code>, <code>biolink:MolecularEntity</code>. In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature <code>f</code> may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink.

A gene locus may include regulatory regions, transcribed regions and/or other functional sequence regions. Polypeptide A polypeptide is a molecular entity characterized by availability in protein databases of amino-acid-based sequence representations of its precise primary structure; for convenience of representation, partial sequences of various kinds are included, even if they do not represent a physical molecule. ProteinDomain A conserved part of protein sequence and (tertiary) structure that can evolve, function, and exist independently of the rest of the protein chain. Protein domains maintain their structure and function independently of the proteins in which they are found. e.g. an SH3 domain.

This is determined by the id using expansion rules.  0..1  IriType Entity category:   Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag. In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI. This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values <code>biolink:Protein</code>, <code>biolink:GeneProduct</code>, <code>biolink:MolecularEntity</code>. In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature <code>f</code> may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing}  0..*  CategoryType Entity type:   rdf:type of biolink:Association should be fixed at rdf:Statement  0..*  String Entity name:   A human-readable name for an attribute or entity.  0..1  LabelType Entity description:   a human-readable description of an entity  0..1  NarrativeText Entity has_attribute:   connects any entity to an attribute  0..*  Attribute Entity deprecated:   A boolean flag indicating that an entity is no longer considered current or valid.  0..1  Boolean Entity"},{"location":"EntityToDiseaseAssociation/#linkml-source","title":"LinkML Source","text":"<pre><code>name: entity to disease association\nfrom_schema: https://w3id.org/biolink/biolink-model\nis_a: association\nslots:\n- clinical approval status\n- max research phase\ndefining_slots:\n- subject\n- object\n\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin/","title":"Class: EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin","text":"Description: mixin class for any association whose object (target node) is a disease <pre><code> classDiagram\n    class EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin\n      EntityToFeatureOrDiseaseQualifiersMixin &lt;|-- EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin\n\n\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin &lt;|-- GeneToDiseaseAssociation\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin &lt;|-- CausalGeneToDiseaseAssociation\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin &lt;|-- CorrelatedGeneToDiseaseAssociation\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin &lt;|-- DruggableGeneToDiseaseAssociation\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin &lt;|-- PhenotypicFeatureToDiseaseAssociation\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin &lt;|-- VariantToDiseaseAssociation\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin &lt;|-- GenotypeToDiseaseAssociation\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin &lt;|-- GeneAsAModelOfDiseaseAssociation\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin &lt;|-- VariantAsAModelOfDiseaseAssociation\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin &lt;|-- GenotypeAsAModelOfDiseaseAssociation\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin &lt;|-- CellLineAsAModelOfDiseaseAssociation\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin &lt;|-- OrganismalEntityAsAModelOfDiseaseAssociation\n\n\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin : frequency_qualifier\n\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin : object\n\n          EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin --|&gt; Disease : object\n\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin : object_aspect_qualifier\n\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin : object_direction_qualifier\n\n          EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin --|&gt; DirectionQualifierEnum : object_direction_qualifier\n\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin : predicate\n\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin : qualified_predicate\n\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin : subject\n\n          EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin --|&gt; NamedThing : subject\n\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin : subject_aspect_qualifier\n\n      EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin : subject_direction_qualifier\n\n          EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin --|&gt; DirectionQualifierEnum : subject_direction_qualifier\n\n\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin/#inheritance","title":"Inheritance","text":"<ul> <li>FrequencyQualifierMixin<ul> <li>EntityToFeatureOrDiseaseQualifiersMixin<ul> <li>EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"EntityToDiseaseAssociationMixin/#slots","title":"Slots","text":"Name Cardinality and Range Inheritance Examples subject_aspect_qualifier:   Composes with the core concept to describe new concepts of a different ontological type. e.g. a process in which the core concept participates, a function/activity/role held by the core concept, or a characteristic/quality that inheres in the core concept.

This qualifier holds a relationship to be used instead of that expressed by the primary predicate, in a \u2018full statement\u2019 reading of the association, where qualifier-based semantics are included.  This is necessary only in cases where the primary predicate does not work in a full statement reading.  0..1  String direct species_context_qualifier:   A statement qualifier representing a taxonomic category of species in which a relationship expressed in an association took place.  0..1  OrganismTaxon direct subject:   connects an association to the subject of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.  1..1  GeneOrGeneProduct Association predicate:   A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate. This is analogous to category for nodes.  1..1  PredicateType Association object:   connects an association to the object of the association.

In practice, implementers should use one of the more specific subtypes of this generic property.  0..1  String Association primary_knowledge_source:   The most upstream source of the knowledge expressed in an Association that an implementer can identify.  Performing a rigorous analysis of upstream data providers is expected; every effort is made to catalog the most upstream source of data in this property.  Only one data source should be declared primary in any association.  \"aggregator knowledge source\" can be used to capture non-primary sources.  0..1  String Association aggregator_knowledge_source:   An intermediate aggregator resource from which knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved downstream of the original source, on its path to its current serialized form.  0..*  String Association timepoint:   a point in time  0..1  TimeType Association original_subject:   used to hold the original subject of a relation (or predicate) that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification.  0..1  String Association original_predicate:   used to hold the original relation/predicate that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification.  0..1  Uriorcurie Association original_object:   used to hold the original object of a relation (or predicate) that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification.  0..1  String Association subject_category:   Used to hold the biolink class/category of an association.

Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI  1..1  String Entity iri:   An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.  0..1  IriType Entity category:   Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag. In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI. This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values <code>biolink:Protein</code>, <code>biolink:GeneProduct</code>, <code>biolink:MolecularEntity</code>. In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature <code>f</code> may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing}  0..*  CategoryType Entity type:   rdf:type of biolink:Association should be fixed at rdf:Statement

Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI  1..1  String Entity iri:   An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.  0..1  IriType Entity category:   Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag. In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI. This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values <code>biolink:Protein</code>, <code>biolink:GeneProduct</code>, <code>biolink:MolecularEntity</code>. In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature <code>f</code> may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing}  0..*  CategoryType Entity type:   rdf:type of biolink:Association should be fixed at rdf:Statement  0..*  String Entity name:   A human-readable name for an attribute or entity.  0..1  LabelType Entity description:   a human-readable description of an entity  0..1  NarrativeText Entity has_attribute:   connects any entity to an attribute  0..*  Attribute Entity deprecated:   A boolean flag indicating that an entity is no longer considered current or valid.  0..1  Boolean Entity has_count:   number of things with a particular property  0..1  Integer FrequencyQuantifier has_total:   total number of things in a particular reference set  0..1  Integer FrequencyQuantifier has_quotient:   None  0..1  Double FrequencyQuantifier has_percentage:   equivalent to has quotient multiplied by 100  0..1  Double FrequencyQuantifier subject_direction_qualifier:   Composes with the core concept (+ aspect if provided) to describe a change in its direction or degree. This qualifier qualifies the subject of an association (aka: statement).  0..1  DirectionQualifierEnum EntityToFeatureOrDiseaseQualifiersMixin object_aspect_qualifier:   Composes with the core concept to describe new concepts of a different ontological type. e.g. a process in which the core concept participates, a function/activity/role held by the core concept, or a characteristic/quality that inheres in the core concept.  The purpose of the aspect slot is to indicate what aspect is being affected in an 'affects' association.  This qualifier specifies a change in the object of an association (aka: statement).  0..1  String EntityToFeatureOrDiseaseQualifiersMixin stability, abundance, expression, exposure qualified_predicate:   Predicate to be used in an association when subject and object qualifiers are present and the full reading of the statement requires a qualification to the predicate in use in order to refine or increase the specificity of the full statement reading.  This qualifier holds a relationship to be used instead of that expressed by the primary predicate, in a \u2018full statement\u2019 reading of the association, where qualifier-based semantics are included.  This is necessary only in cases where the primary predicate does not work in a full statement reading.  0..1  String EntityToFeatureOrDiseaseQualifiersMixin frequency_qualifier:   a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state how frequent the phenotype is observed in the subject  0..1  FrequencyValue FrequencyQualifierMixin"},{"location":"GeneHasVariantThatContributesToDiseaseAssociation/#linkml-source","title":"LinkML Source","text":"<pre><code>name: gene has variant that contributes to disease association\nfrom_schema: https://w3id.org/biolink/biolink-model\nis_a: gene to disease association\nslots:\n- subject form or variant qualifier\nslot_usage:\n  subject:\n    name: subject\n    description: A gene that has a role in modeling the disease.

type or gross anatomical part Article a piece of writing on a particular topic presented as a stand-alone section of a larger publication Book This class may rarely be instantiated except if use cases of a given knowledge graph support its utility. BookChapter None Disease A disorder of structure or function, especially one that produces specific signs, phenotypes or symptoms or that affects a specific location and is not simply a direct result of physical injury.  A disposition to undergo pathological processes that exists in an organism because of one or more disorders in that organism. ExposureEvent A (possibly time bounded) incidence of a feature of the environment of an organism that influences one or more phenotypic features of that organism, potentially mediated by genes Gene A region (or regions) that includes all of the sequence elements necessary to encode a functional transcript. A gene locus may include regulatory regions, transcribed regions and/or other functional sequence regions. GeneFamily any grouping of multiple genes or gene products related by common descent Genome A genome is the sum of genetic material within a cell or virion. Genotype An information content entity that describes a genome by specifying the total variation in genomic sequence and/or gene expression, relative to some established background InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation association between a named thing and a information content entity where the specific context of the relationship between that named thing and the publication is unknown. For example, model organisms databases often capture the knowledge that a gene is found in a journal article, but not specifically the context in which that gene was documented in the article. In these cases, this association with the accompanying predicate 'mentions' could be used. Conversely, for more specific associations (like 'gene to disease association', the publication should be captured as an edge property). LifeStage A stage of development or growth of an organism, including post-natal adult stages MacromolecularComplex A stable assembly of two or more macromolecules, i.e. proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates or lipids, in which at least one component is a protein and the constituent parts function together. MicroRNA None NucleicAcidEntity A nucleic acid entity is a molecular entity characterized by availability in gene databases of nucleotide-based sequence representations of its precise sequence; for convenience of representation, partial sequences of various kinds are included. OrganismTaxon A classification of a set of organisms. Example instances: NCBITaxon:9606 (Homo sapiens), NCBITaxon:2 (Bacteria). Can also be used to represent strains or subspecies. PhenotypicFeature A combination of entity and quality that makes up a phenotyping statement. An observable characteristic of an individual resulting from the interaction of its genotype with its molecular and physical environment. Polypeptide A polypeptide is a molecular entity characterized by availability in protein databases of amino-acid-based sequence representations of its precise primary structure; for convenience of representation, partial sequences of various kinds are included, even if they do not represent a physical molecule. PopulationOfIndividualOrganisms A collection of individuals from the same taxonomic class distinguished by one or more characteristics.  Characteristics can include, but are not limited to, shared geographic location, genetics, phenotypes. Publication Any \u2018published\u2019 piece of information. Publications are considered broadly to include any document or document part made available in print or on the web - which may include scientific journal issues, individual articles, and books - as well as things like pre-prints, white papers, patents, drug labels, web pages, protocol documents,  and even a part of a publication if of significant knowledge scope (e.g. a figure, figure legend, or section highlighted by NLP). ReagentTargetedGene A gene altered in its expression level in the context of some experiment as a result of being targeted by gene-knockdown reagent(s) such as a morpholino or RNAi. SequenceVariant A sequence_variant is a non exact copy of a sequence_feature or genome exhibiting one or more sequence_alteration. Serial This class may rarely be instantiated except if use cases of a given knowledge graph support its utility. SiRNA A small RNA molecule that is the product of a longer exogenous or endogenous dsRNA, which is either a bimolecular duplex or very long hairpin, processed (via the Dicer pathway) such that numerous siRNAs accumulate from both strands of the dsRNA. SRNAs trigger the cleavage of their target molecules.

Note that\n  nodes in a biolink compatible KG can be considered both instances of biolink classes,\n  and OWL classes in their own right. In general you should not need to use this class\n  directly. Instead, use the appropriate biolink class. For example, for the GO concept\n  of endocytosis (GO:0006897), use bl:BiologicalProcess as the type.\ncomments:\n- This is modeled as a mixin. 'ontology class' should not be the primary type of a\n  node in the KG. Instead you should use an informative bioloink category, such as\n  AnatomicalEntity (for Uberon classes), ChemicalSubstance (for CHEBI or CHEMBL),\n  etc\n- Note that formally this is a metaclass. Instances of this class are instances in\n  the graph, but can be the object of 'type' edges.

For example, the qualifier \u2018mutation\u2019 combines with the core concept \u2018Gene X\u2019 to express the compose concept \u2018a mutation of Gene X\u2019.  This qualifier specifies a change in the subject of an association (aka: statement). subject_part_qualifier defines a specific part/component of the core concept (used in cases there this specific part has no IRI we can use to directly represent it, e.g. 'ESR1 transcript' q: polyA tail).  This qualifier is for the  subject of an association (or statement). superclass_of holds between two classes where the domain class is a super class of the range class support_graphs A list of knowledge graphs that support the existence of this association. synonym Alternate human-readable names for a thing treated_by None treats Holds between an intervention (substance, procedure, or activity) and a medical condition (disease or phenotypic feature), and states that the intervention is able to ameliorate, stabilize, or cure the condition or delay, prevent, or reduce the risk of it manifesting in the first place. \u2018Treats\u2019 edges should be asserted (knowledge_level: assertion) only in cases where there is strong supporting evidence - i.e. the intervention is approved or in phase 4 trials for the condition, or is an otherwise established treatment in the medical community (e.g. a widely-accepted or formally recommended off-label use). In the absence of such evidence, weaker predicates should be used in asserted edges (e.g. \u2018in clinical trials for\u2019 or \u2018beneficial in models of\u2019). \u2018Treats\u2019 edges based on weaker or indirect forms of evidence can however be created as predictions (knowledge_level: prediction) and should point to the more foundational asserted edges that support them. treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat Holds between an substance, procedure, or activity and a medical condition (disease or phenotypic feature), and states that the substance, procedure, or activity is able to treat the condition, has been observed to be taken/prescribed in practice with the intent of treating the condition, or has been interrogated in a scientific study that hypothesized an ability to treat the condition (in humans or other biological systems/organisms). xenologous_to a homology relationship characterized by an interspecies (horizontal) transfer since the common ancestor. xref A database cross reference or alternative identifier for a NamedThing or edge between two NamedThings.

Biolink Model can be used to formalize the relationships between data structures in translational science. It incorporates object-oriented classification and graph-oriented features. The core of the model is a set of hierarchical, interconnected classes (or categories) and relationships between them (or predicates). The model provides class and edge attributes and associations that guide how entities should relate to one another.

This is preferred over minting new ontology  terms at a more granular level than is practical, or using structured data objects as Statement subject/objects.</li> <li>The \u2018core triple\u2019 should remain true if qualifiers are ignored: When using qualifiers, ensure that the core SPO triple remains true when qualifiers are ignored. (However, note that there may be one predicate used for the core triple and a  different predicate for the qualified assertion.)

This will facilitate clear and  consistent creation of data, and simplify query construction and answering.</li> </ul> <p>As an example, let's consider the definition of class  <code>chemical affects gene association</code>:</p> <pre><code>  chemical affects gene association:\n    description: &gt;-\n      Describes an effect that a chemical has on a gene or gene product (e.g. an impact of on its abundance, activity,\n      localization, processing, expression, etc.)\n    is_a: association\n    slots:\n      - subject form or variant qualifier\n      - subject part qualifier\n      - subject derivative qualifier\n      - subject aspect qualifier\n      - subject context qualifier\n      - subject direction qualifier\n      - object form or variant qualifier\n      - object part qualifier\n      - object aspect qualifier\n      - object context qualifier\n      - causal mechanism qualifier\n      - anatomical context qualifier\n      - qualified predicate\n    slot_usage:\n      subject:\n        range: chemical entity\n      subject form or variant qualifier:\n        range: chemical_or_gene_or_gene_product_form_or_variant_enum\n      subject part qualifier:\n        range: gene_or_gene_product_or_chemical_part_qualifier_enum\n      subject derivative qualifier:\n        range: chemical_entity_derivative_enum\n      subject aspect qualifier:\n        range: gene_or_gene_product_or_chemical_entity_aspect_enum\n      subject context qualifier:\n        range: anatomical entity\n      subject direction qualifier:\n        range: direction_qualifier_enum\n      predicate:\n        subproperty_of: affects\n      qualified predicate:\n        subproperty_of: causes\n      object:\n        range: gene or gene product\n      object form or variant qualifier:\n        range: chemical_or_gene_or_gene_product_form_or_variant_enum\n      object part qualifier:\n        range: gene_or_gene_product_or_chemical_part_qualifier_enum\n      object aspect qualifier:\n        range: gene_or_gene_product_or_chemical_entity_aspect_enum\n      object context qualifier:\n        range: anatomical entity\n      object direction qualifier:\n        range: direction_qualifier_enum\n      causal mechanism qualifier:\n        range: causal_mechanism_qualifier_enum\n      anatomical context qualifier:\n        range: anatomical entity\n      species context qualifier:\n        range: organism taxon\n</code></pre> <p>In the above YAML snippet, we first define the class <code>chemical affects gene association</code> as a subclass of <code>association</code>  and then we define the slots that this class will have.  Many of these slots represent qualifiers that are used to  refine the meaning of the association. For example, <code>object form or variant qualifier</code> is a slot that is used to describe when a \"mutant form\" of a gene is used in an assertion.  This allows us to both represent that the gene of interest (the object) is somehow related to the chemical of interest (the subject), and also that more specifically we may be talking about a \"mutant form\" of the gene.  \"mutant form\" is a <code>biolink:object_form_or_variant_qualifier</code>.  This  kind of modeling allows us to increase connectivity in graphs by using a core biological concept (gene) but also be more specific and nuanced about the meaning of the association by qualifying the concept (gene) with a more specific form of \"mutant form\" of that concept. </p> <p>We find the diagram below to be a helpful visualization of an association class and its components. </p> <p>For more information on qualifiers, please refer to Reading a Qualifier Based Statement</p> <p>For more information on what each slot means and how to use them in Biolink Model, refer to Using the Modeling Language.</p>"},{"location":"curating-the-model/#adding-a-predicate","title":"Adding a predicate","text":"<p>A predicate is a slot that links two instances of a class. </p> <p>To add a predicate to Biolink Model you need to determine the following:   - What is an appropriate name for this predicate?

Sometimes the  hardest part of using a shared model, is the art and science of mapping an existing concept to that model. Biolink Model is not an exception to this rule, but it does provide more metadata about each element in the model to help guide this process.  Biolink Model classes and slots have descriptions, mappings, and class have  expected id_prefixes for identifiers that define an instance of that class. </p> <p>The Biolink Model Toolkit (bmt) provides some very helpful functions for programmatically interacting with the model.  For example, bmt can be used to find all the classes that have a particular id_prefix, or all of the slots that have a particular range.

We also welcome pull requests (PRs)!  In general, an issue or a PR will be addressed faster by the modeling team by following these guidelines:</p> <ul> <li>All of our modeling and example data should be as clear as possible.</li> <li>Textual annotations on classes, slots and enumerations should be written with minimal jargon.  Of course, jargon is hard to define. We encourage contributors to use their best judgement here, but expect that there are a wide variety of people using and interacting with Biolink Model.  Our language here should be interpretable by people with many different expertises.  Examples are the key to good PRs.</li> <li>Team members  adding new modeling bear the responsibility of re-using existing elements or demonstrating to the team  how their proposed alternative modeling is generally superior. This can be simplified by keeping pull requests small.  Diligent modeling efforts should be acknowledged, especially for newer contributors. A decision to not merge in part of the work does not mean that the work isn\u2019t appreciated or has been thrown away, as closed but unmerged pull  requests could be revisited in the future.</li> <li>LinkML provides micro-crediting metaslots. They can be used to acknowledge contributors outside of GitHub pull request crediting and to time-stamp additions and changes.  They should be employed whenever possible, giving by default, maximum credit to all parties that have significantly contributed to the model element.<ul> <li>https://linkml.io/linkml-model/latest/docs/contributors/</li> <li>https://linkml.io/linkml-model/latest/docs/created_by/</li> <li>https://linkml.io/linkml-model/latest/docs/created_on/</li> <li>https://linkml.io/linkml-model/latest/docs/modified_by/ </li> <li>https://linkml.io/linkml-model/latest/docs/last_updated_on/</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"faq/#what-is-the-difference-between-predicate-and-category","title":"What is the difference between <code>predicate</code> and <code>category</code>?","text":"<ul> <li><code>predicate</code> is an association slot and must have a value from the <code>related to</code> hierarchy</li> <li><code>category</code> (or <code>rdf:type</code>) is a slot and must have a value from the <code>named thing</code> or the <code>association</code> hierarchy.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"faq/#what-are-some-examples-of-biolink-model-usage","title":"What are some examples of Biolink Model usage?","text":"<p>The NCATS Biomedical Translator Consortium has adopted Biolink Model as an open-source upper-level  data model that supports semantic harmonization and reasoning across diverse Translator \u2018knowledge sources\u2019.  The model serves a central role in the Translator program and forms the architectural basis of the Translator system,  as described below. </p> <p>The Translator program aims to develop a comprehensive, relational, N-dimensional infrastructure designed to integrate disparate data  sources\u2014including objective signs and symptoms of disease, drug effects, chemical and genetic interactions, cell and organ pathology,  and other relevant biological entities and relations\u2014and reason over the integrated data to rapidly derive biomedical insights.  The ultimate goal of Translator is to augment human reasoning and thereby accelerate translational science and knowledge discovery. </p> <p>To achieve its ambitious goal, the Translator project assembled a diverse interdisciplinary team and a variety of biomedical data  sources, including electronic health record data, clinical trial data, genomic and other -omics data, chemical reaction data, and  drug data. There are hundreds of data sources in the Translator ecosystem, each of which had its own data representation and were  in formats that were not compatible or interoperable. Moreover, groups within the Translator Consortium had integrated the data  sources as knowledge sources within independent KGs, but these KGs were developed using different technologies and formalisms  such as property graphs in Neo4j and semantically-linked data via RDF and OWL. </p> <p>In order to interoperate between knowledge sources and reason across KGs, Biolink Model was adopted as the common dialect, thus  enabling queries over the entire Translator KG ecosystem. The result was a federated, harmonized ecosystem that supports advanced  reasoning and inference to derive biomedical insights based on user queries.</p> <p>An example Translator use case involved a collaboration with investigators at the Hugh Kaul Precision Medicine Institute (PMI) at  the University of Alabama at Birmingham. PMI investigators posed the following natural-language question to the Translator Consortium:  what chemicals or drugs might be used to treat neurological disorders such as epilepsy that are associated with genomic  variants of RHOBTB2? The investigators noted that RHOBTB2 variants cause an accumulation of RHOBTB2 protein and that this  accumulation is believed to be the cause of the neurological disorder. </p> <p>To answer the PMI investigator\u2019s question, Translator team members structured the following query: </p> <p>NCBIGene:23221 (CURIE for RHOBTB2) -&gt; [biolink:entity_regulates_entity, biolink:genetically_interacts_with] -&gt; biolink:Protein,  biolink:Gene -&gt; [biolink:related_to] -&gt; biolink:SmallMolecule</p> <p>(see Figure 2 below). Because of the hierarchical structure of the Biolink model, the use of biolink:related_to also will return more specific predicates such as biolink:negatively_regulates and biolink:positively_regulates.  The objective was to identify drugs or chemicals that might regulate RHOBTB2 in some manner and thereby reduce the variant-induced  accumulation of RHOBTB2 and associated neurological symptoms. As all nodes and edges within the Translator KG ecosystem are  annotated to Biolink Model classes and attributes, a Translator query can be constructed from a natural-language user question  and return results across a multitude of independent data sources. In addition, because the model employs hierarchical classes,  with inheritance and polymorphism, natural-language queries translated to graph queries using Biolink Model syntax can be  constructed at varying levels of granularity and return results from all levels of the hierarchy. Finally, because Biolink  Model provides attributes on both edges and nodes that record provenance and evidence for these knowledge statements, each  result is annotated with the trail of evidence that supports it.</p> <p>When Translator team members sent the query to the Translator system, it returned several candidates of interest to PMI investigators,  including fostamatinib disodium (CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL3989516) and ruxolitinib (CHEMBL.COMPOUND:CHEMBL1789941).  A review of the supporting evidence provided by Translator indicates that these are approved drugs that either directly or  indirectly reduce or otherwise regulate the expression of RHOBTB2. Thus, Biolink Model helped Translator teams bring data  together into a single system, thereby reducing the burden on the user to find and manually assemble data from these independent resources  (see citation below).</p> <p> Figure 2. An overview of the Translator architecture that supports biomedical KG-based question-answering, including the  role of Biolink Model, in the context of an example question. In this example, a user has posed the natural-language question:  what chemicals or drugs might be used to treat neurological disorders such as epilepsy that are associated with genomic variants of  RHOBTB2? The question is translated into a graph query, as shown in the top left panel, which is then translated into a  Translator standard machine query (not shown). The KG shown in the second panel from the left is derived from a variety of diverse \u2018knowledge sources\u2019, a subset of which are displayed in the figure, that are exposed by Translator \u2018knowledge providers\u2019.  Biolink Model provides standardization and semantic harmonization across the disparate knowledge sources, thereby allowing  them to be integrated into a KG capable of supporting question-answering. In this example, Translator provided two answers or  results of interest to the investigative team that posed the question, namely, fostamatinib disodium and ruxolitinib, as shown  in the bottom left panel. </p>"},{"location":"faq/#citing-biolink-model","title":"Citing Biolink Model","text":"<p>Unni DR, Moxon SAT, Bada M, Brush M, Bruskiewich R, Caufield JH, Clemons PA, Dancik V, Dumontier M, Fecho K, Glusman G,  Hadlock JJ, Harris NL, Joshi A, Putman T, Qin G, Ramsey SA, Shefchek KA, Solbrig H, Soman K, Thessen AE, Haendel MA,  Bizon C, Mungall CJ, The Biomedical Data Translator Consortium (2022).

Note that many such Associations will consist only of a subject-predicate-object triple - in which case a reading of the statement expressed is straight-forward.  When qualifiers are included, this introduces a second level of meaning that complements the statement made by the core SPO triple. This idea that there can be two related statements at two levels of granularity encoded in a single Association is a critical idea behind the qualifier-based approach: The first level is the Core Triple Reading of the Association, which considers only the subject, predicate, and object slots.  This reading must be clear and true. The second level is the Full Statement Reading of the Association, which considers the semantics added by qualifier slots (subject/object qualifiers, and statement qualifiers).  This reading must also be clear and true as well (which often requires use of a qualified_predicate).

In fact, we also use association objects to hold references to the publications, confidence scores, and other metadata that we use to support our assertions.</p> <p>Associations are arranged in a hierarchy where the root of all Associations is the <code>association</code> class.  In general,  Associations have three main properties (or slots):   * <code>subject</code>: the subject of the association   * <code>predicate</code>: the predicate or relationship between the subject and the object of the association   * <code>object</code>: the object of the association These three properties (or slots) define what Biolink calls a \"core triple\".</p> <p>Subjects and objects are always classes in the Biolink Model that are descendants of \"biolink:NamedThing\" and  represent core biological, chemical, and biomedical concepts (e.g. genes, diseases, chemicals, phenotypes),  whose IRIs come from community standard ontologies (e.g. HGNC, MONDO, ChEBI, HPO).  As a best practice,  Biolink Model prioritizes connectivity and practicality. </p> <p>The predicate in an Association is always a Biolink property (or slot) that is or descends from the \"biolink:related_to\"  property.  Predicates in Biolink often are exactly equivalent to relations in the Relations Ontology.  </p> <p>To express more complex or nuanced Statements, we use additional slots called qualifiers that  refine or extend the  meaning of the core triple. At the highest level we distinguish two kinds of qualifiers: (1) node qualifiers altering  the meaning of the Association subject or object specifically; (2) statement qualifiers refine or extend the meaning  of the statement as a whole. </p> <p>Together, the subject, predicate, object, and optional qualifier(s) comprise the full semantics of the statement that  an Association puts forth as true (i.e. its \u2018S-P-O-Q\u2019 semantics).  Association objects may also include slots to  hold additional metadata about this core statement - primarily information about the provenance and evidence supporting it.  Using these elements together we can build Associations with many possible \u2018layers\u2019 of complexity (Figure 1).  Some Associations may simply consist of an S-P-O triple. Others may represent more complex statements that employ  multiple qualifiers, supported by rich evidence and provenance metadata. For example, Figure 2 provides a layered  view of a complex Disease to Phenotype Association instance. </p> <p>Figure 1: A layered view of a simple a Biolink Association object. )</p> <p>Figure 2: An Association representing the Statement that \u201cLate Stage Ebola has phenotype Severe Bleeding with 92% penetrance in adults\u201d, and some provenance metadata supporting this. This representation leans heavily on qualifiers  for representing Statement semantics. </p> <p></p> <p>At the highest level we distinguish two kinds of qualifiers that contribute to an Association Statement:  * node qualifiers (aka subject / object qualifiers) extend or refine the meaning of an Association subject or object concept; * statement qualifiers refine or extend the meaning of the core S-P-O triple as a whole.</p> <p>Together, the subject, predicate, object, and optional qualifier(s) comprise the full semantics of the statement that an  Association puts forth as true (i.e. its \u2018S-P-O-Q\u2019 semantics).  Association objects may also include slots to hold  Metadata about this core statement - primarily information about the provenance and evidence supporting it - but unlike  qualifiers, this metadata does not contribute to the meaning of the core Statement itself.  Using these qualifier and metadata elements together, we can build Associations with many possible \u2018layers\u2019 of complexity.</p> <p>Sometimes, seeing several examples of a modeling pattern is most helpful in applying the pattern to your own data.
