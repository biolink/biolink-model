## Mappings

## Inheritance

 *  is_a: [Association](Association.md) - A typed association between two entities, supported by evidence
## Children

 * [DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociationToLocationAssociation](DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociationToLocationAssociation.md) - An association between either a disease or a phenotypic feature and an anatomical entity, where the disease/feature manifests in that site.
