description: Any association between one genotype and a phenotypic feature, where
  having the genotype confers the phenotype, either in isolation or through environment

- description: connects an association to the object of the association. For example,
    in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.

    phenotype is in the subject
