    which might typically otherwise be more completely documented in biolink:PublicationToProviderAssociation

    identifiers (curies when feasible). Precedence of identifiers for scientific articles
    is as follows: PMID if available; DOI if not; actual alternate CURIE otherwise.
    Enclosing publications (i.e. referenced by ''published in'' node property) such
    as books and journals, should have industry-standard identifier such as from ISBN
    and ISSN.'
