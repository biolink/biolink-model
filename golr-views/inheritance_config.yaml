description: The name of this attribute and its inheritance from organism attribute,
  indeed, its designation as an attribute is problematic. First, the isolated word
  'inheritance' is too ambiguous (especially when embedded inside an ontology with
  inheritance!). 'Genetic inheritance' would be more precise. Second, in terms of
  the scientific usage here, genetic inheritance would not be a direct property at
  the topmost organism level, but rather (as hinted in the definition) is more a commentary
  on the nature of phenotype (including  genetic disease as a characteristic set of
  associated phenotypes) against the (hidden) context of (meiotic/somatic/mitochondrial)
  DNA segregation and expression.  Third, placing  the term in the attribute, rather
  than named thing category concept hierarchy, is perhaps less flexible in terms of
  its usage as a first class concept for semantic queries. Thus, we deprecate this
  term, moving it to the 'new' category of 'genetic inheritance',  as a child of 'biological
  entity' (to emphasize its biological conceptual nature).

  description: "Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized.\
    \ Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.\n * In a neo4j database\
    \ this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.\n * In an RDF database it should\
    \ be a biolink model class URI.\nThis field is multi-valued. It should include\
    \ values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh\
    \ would have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`,\
    \ ...\nIn an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This\
    \ can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific\
    \ than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type\
    \ assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than\
    \ anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity,\
    \ biolink:NamedThing}"
