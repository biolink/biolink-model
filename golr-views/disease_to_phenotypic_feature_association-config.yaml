  phenotypic feature is associated with the disease in some way

weight: 20
fields:
- id: subject
  description: connects an association to the subject of the association. For example,
    in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
  display_name: subject
- id: relation
  description: The relation which describes an association between a subject and an
    object in a more granular manner. Usually this is a term from Relation Ontology,
    but it can be any edge CURIE.
  display_name: relation

  description: connects an association to the object of the association. For example,
    in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.

  description: a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state whether the association
    is specific to a particular sex.
  display_name: sex qualifier
- id: description
  description: A description of specific aspects of this phenotype, not otherwise
    covered by the phenotype ontology class
  display_name: entity to phenotypic feature association_description
- id: frequency_qualifier
  description: a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state how frequent
    the phenotype is observed in the subject
  display_name: frequency qualifier
- id: severity_qualifier
  description: a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state how severe the
    phenotype is in the subject
  display_name: severity qualifier

  description: a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state when the phenotype
    appears is in the subject
  display_name: onset qualifier
