schema_generating: true
description: A homology association between two genes. May be orthology (in which
  case the species of subject and object should differ) or paralogy (in which case
  the species may be the same)

  description: A unique identifier for an association
  display_name: association_id
- id: association_type
  description: connects an association to the type of association (e.g. gene to phenotype)
  display_name: association type
- id: predicate
  description: A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate.
    This is analogous to category for nodes.

    of that association

  description: connects an association to the agent (person, organization or group)
    that provided it

  description: the subject gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric,
    subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as proxy for
    the gene or vice versa
