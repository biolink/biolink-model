fields:
- id: id
  description: A unique identifier for an association
  display_name: association_id
- id: association_type
  description: connects an association to the type of association (e.g. gene to phenotype)

  description: A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate.
    This is analogous to category for nodes.
  display_name: predicate
- id: relation
  description: The relation which describes an association between a subject and an
    object in a more granular manner. Usually this is a term from Relation Ontology,
    but it can be any edge CURIE.
  display_name: relation
- id: negated
  description: if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true
  display_name: negated

  description: connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning
    of that association
  display_name: qualifiers

  description: the population that is observed to have the frequency
  display_name: variant to population association_object
- id: has_quotient
  description: frequency of allele in population, expressed as a number with allele
    divided by number in reference population, aka allele frequency
  display_name: variant to population association_has quotient

  display_name: variant to population association_has total
- id: has_percentage
  description: equivalent to has quotient multiplied by 100
  display_name: has percentage
- id: frequency_qualifier
  description: a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state how frequent
    the phenotype is observed in the subject
