      The Columbia Open Health Data (COHD) API provides access to counts
      and frequencies (i.e., EHR prevalence) of conditions, procedures, drug exposures,
      and patient demographics, and the co-occurrence frequencies between them. Count
      and frequency data were derived from the [Columbia University Medical Center''s](http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/)
      [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/) database including inpatient and outpatient data.
      Counts are the number of patients associated with the concept, e.g., diagnosed
      with a condition, exposed to a drug, or who had a procedure. Frequencies are the
      number of unique patients associated with the concept divided by the total number
      of patients in the dataset, i.e., prevalence in the electronic health records.
      To protect patient privacy, all concepts and pairs of concepts where the count
      <= 10 were excluded, and counts were randomized by the Poisson distribution.           Four
      datasets are available:  1) 5-year non-hierarchical dataset: Includes clinical
      data from 2013-2017   2) lifetime non-hierarchical dataset: Includes clinical
      data from all dates   3) 5-year hierarchical dataset: Counts for each concept
      include patients from descendant concepts. Includes clinical data from 2013-2017.
      4) BETA! Temporal co-occurrence data  In the 5-year hierarchical data set, the
      counts for each concept include the patients from all descendant concepts. For
      example, the count for ibuprofen (ID 1177480) includes patients with Ibuprofen
      600 MG Oral Tablet (ID 19019073 patients), Ibuprofen 400 MG Oral Tablet (ID 19019072),
      Ibuprofen 20 MG/ML Oral Suspension (ID 19019050), etc.   While the lifetime dataset
      captures a larger patient population and range of concepts, the 5-year dataset
      has better underlying data consistency.   Clinical concepts (e.g., conditions,
      procedures, drugs) are coded by their standard concept ID in the [OMOP Common
      Data Model](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki). API methods are provided
      to map to/from other vocabularies supported in OMOP and other ontologies using
      the EMBL-EBI Ontology Xref Service (OxO).    The following resources are available
      through this API:    1. Metadata: Metadata on the COHD database, including dataset
      descriptions, number of concepts, etc.    2. OMOP: Access to the common vocabulary
      for name and concept identifier mapping   3. Clinical Frequencies: Access to the
      counts and frequencies of conditions, procedures, and drug exposures, and the
      associations between them. Frequency was determined as the number of patients
      with the code(s) / total number of patients.    4. Concept Associations: Inferred
      associations between concepts using chi-square analysis, ratio between observed
      to expected frequency, and relative frequency.    A [Python notebook](https://github.com/WengLab-InformaticsResearch/cohd_api/blob/master/notebooks/COHD_API_Example.ipynb)
      demonstrates simple examples of how to use the COHD API.   COHD was developed
      at the [Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/)
      as a collaboration between the [Weng Lab](http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~chw7007/),
      [Tatonetti Lab](http://tatonettilab.org/), and the [NCATS Biomedical Data Translator](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator)

      The Columbia Open Health Data (COHD) for COVID-19 Research API provides
      access to counts and frequencies (i.e., EHR visit prevalence) of conditions, procedures,
      drug exposures, and the co-occurrence frequencies between them for a cohort of
      hospitalized COVID-19 patients and two comparator cohorts of hospitalized influenza
      patients and hospitalized patients. Count and frequency data were derived from
      the [Columbia University Medical Center''s](http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/) [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/)
      database including inpatient. Counts are the number of inpatient visits associated
      with the concept, e.g., diagnosed with a condition, exposed to a drug, or a procedure
      was performed. Frequencies are the number of unique visits associated with the
      concept divided by the total number of visits in the dataset, i.e., prevalence
      in the electronic health records. To protect patient privacy, all concepts and
      pairs of concepts where the count <= 10 were excluded, and counts were randomized
      by the Poisson distribution.           Datasets from three primary cohorts are
      available:  1) COVID-19: Hospitalized patients aged 18 or older with a COVID-19
      related condition diagnosis and/or a confirmed positive COVID-19 test during their
      hospitalization period or within the prior 21 days. Date range: March 1, 2020
      to September 1, 2020. This cohort is also further stratified by sex (male and
      female) and age (adult: 18-64, senior: 65+). 2) General inpatient: All hospitalized
      patients aged 18 or older. Date range: January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2019. 3)
      Influenza: Hospitalized patients aged 18 or older who had at least one occurrence
      of influenza conditions or pre-coordinated positive measurements or positive influenza
      testing in the prior 21 days or during their hospitalization period. Date range:
      January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2019.  Both hierarchical and non-hierarchical
      datasets are available for each cohort. In the hierarchical datasets, the counts
      for each concept include the visits from all descendant concepts. For example,
      the count for ibuprofen (ID 1177480) includes visits with Ibuprofen 600 MG Oral
      Tablet (ID 19019073), Ibuprofen 400 MG Oral Tablet (ID 19019072), Ibuprofen 20
      MG/ML Oral Suspension (ID 19019050), etc.   Clinical concepts (e.g., conditions,
      procedures, drugs) are coded by their standard concept ID in the [OMOP Common

      The Human Protein Atlas is a Swedish-based program initiated in 2003
      with the aim to map all the human proteins in cells, tissues and organs using
      an integration of various omics technologies, including antibody-based imaging,
      mass spectrometry-based proteomics, transcriptomics and systems biology. All the
      data in the knowledge resource is open access to allow scientists both in academia
      and industry to freely access the data for exploration of the human proteome.

      The Pfam database is a large collection of protein families, each represented
      by multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models (HMMs).  Proteins are
      generally composed of one or more functional regions, commonly termed domains.
      Different combinations of domains give rise to the diverse range of proteins found
      in nature. The identification of domains that occur within proteins can therefore
      provide insights into their function.  Pfam also generates higher-level groupings
      of related entries, known as clans. A clan is a collection of Pfam entries which
      are related by similarity of sequence, structure or profile-HMM.  The data presented
      for each entry is based on the UniProt Reference Proteomes but information on
      individual UniProtKB sequences can still be found by entering the protein accession.
      Pfam full alignments are available from searching a variety of databases, either
      to provide different accessions (e.g. all UniProt and NCBI GI) or different levels
      of redundancy.

      TISSUES is a weekly updated web resource that integrates evidence on tissue expression 
      from manually curated literature, proteomics and transcriptomics screens, and automatic 
      text mining. We map all evidence to common protein identifiers and Brenda Tissue Ontology 
      terms, and further unify it by assigning confidence scores that facilitate comparison of 
      the different types and sources of evidence. We finally visualize these scores on a 
      schematic human body to provide a convenient overview.
