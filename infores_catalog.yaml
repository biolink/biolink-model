  description: '"The Columbia Open Health Data (COHD) API provides access to counts
    and frequencies (i.e., EHR prevalence) of conditions, procedures, drug exposures,
    and patient demographics, and the co-occurrence frequencies between them. Count
    and frequency data were derived from the [Columbia University Medical Center''s](http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/)
    [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/) database including inpatient and outpatient data.
    Counts are the number of patients associated with the concept, e.g., diagnosed
    with a condition, exposed to a drug, or who had a procedure. Frequencies are the
    number of unique patients associated with the concept divided by the total number
    of patients in the dataset, i.e., prevalence in the electronic health records.
    To protect patient privacy, all concepts and pairs of concepts where the count
    <= 10 were excluded, and counts were randomized by the Poisson distribution.           Four
    datasets are available:  1) 5-year non-hierarchical dataset: Includes clinical
    data from 2013-2017   2) lifetime non-hierarchical dataset: Includes clinical
    data from all dates   3) 5-year hierarchical dataset: Counts for each concept
    include patients from descendant concepts. Includes clinical data from 2013-2017.
    4) BETA! Temporal co-occurrence data  In the 5-year hierarchical data set, the
    counts for each concept include the patients from all descendant concepts. For
    example, the count for ibuprofen (ID 1177480) includes patients with Ibuprofen
    600 MG Oral Tablet (ID 19019073 patients), Ibuprofen 400 MG Oral Tablet (ID 19019072),
    Ibuprofen 20 MG/ML Oral Suspension (ID 19019050), etc.   While the lifetime dataset
    captures a larger patient population and range of concepts, the 5-year dataset
    has better underlying data consistency.   Clinical concepts (e.g., conditions,
    procedures, drugs) are coded by their standard concept ID in the [OMOP Common
    Data Model](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki). API methods are provided
    to map to/from other vocabularies supported in OMOP and other ontologies using
    the EMBL-EBI Ontology Xref Service (OxO).    The following resources are available
    through this API:    1. Metadata: Metadata on the COHD database, including dataset
    descriptions, number of concepts, etc.    2. OMOP: Access to the common vocabulary
    for name and concept identifier mapping   3. Clinical Frequencies: Access to the
    counts and frequencies of conditions, procedures, and drug exposures, and the
    associations between them. Frequency was determined as the number of patients
    with the code(s) / total number of patients.    4. Concept Associations: Inferred
    associations between concepts using chi-square analysis, ratio between observed
    to expected frequency, and relative frequency.    A [Python notebook](https://github.com/WengLab-InformaticsResearch/cohd_api/blob/master/notebooks/COHD_API_Example.ipynb)
    demonstrates simple examples of how to use the COHD API.   COHD was developed

  description: The Pfam database is a large collection of protein families, each represented
    by multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models (HMMs).  Proteins are
    generally composed of one or more functional regions, commonly termed domains.
    Different combinations of domains give rise to the diverse range of proteins found
    in nature. The identification of domains that occur within proteins can therefore
    provide insights into their function.  Pfam also generates higher-level groupings
    of related entries, known as clans. A clan is a collection of Pfam entries which
    are related by similarity of sequence, structure or profile-HMM.  The data presented
    for each entry is based on the UniProt Reference Proteomes but information on
    individual UniProtKB sequences can still be found by entering the protein accession.
    Pfam full alignments are available from searching a variety of databases, either
    to provide different accessions (e.g. all UniProt and NCBI GI) or different levels
    of redundancy.
