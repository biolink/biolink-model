<td>Holds between an intervention (substance, procedure, or activity) and a medical condition (disease or phenotypic feature), and states that the intervention is able to ameliorate, stabilize, or cure the condition or delay, prevent, or reduce the risk of it manifesting in the first place. ‘Treats’ edges should be asserted (knowledge_level: assertion) only in cases where there is strong supporting evidence - i.e. the intervention is approved or in phase 4 trials for the condition, or is an otherwise established treatment in the medical community (e.g. a widely-accepted or formally recommended off-label use). In the absence of such evidence, weaker predicates should be used in asserted edges (e.g. ‘in clinical trials for’ or ‘beneficial in models of’). ‘Treats’ edges based on weaker or indirect forms of evidence can however be created as predictions (knowledge_level: prediction) and should point to the more foundational asserted edges that support them.</td>
