slots:

  form or variant qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      A qualifier that composes with a core subject/object concept to define a specific type, variant,
      alternative version of this concept. The composed concept remains a subtype or instance of the core concept.
      For example, the qualifier ‘mutation’ combines with the core concept ‘Gene X’ to express the compose concept
      ‘a mutation of Gene X’.

  aspect qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      Composes with the core concept to describe new concepts of a different ontological type. e.g. a process in which
      the core concept participates, a function/activity/role held by the core concept, or a characteristic/quality that
      inheres in the core concept. The aspect qualifier is loosely defined, as a catch all for qualifiers that don’t fit
      into the other S/O qualifier categories.


  derivative qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      A qualifier that composes with a core subject/object  concept to describe something that is derived from the
      core concept.  For example, the qualifier ‘metabolite’ combines with a ‘Chemical X’ core concept to express
      the composed concept ‘a metabolite of Chemical X’.

  part qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      defines a specific part/component of the core concept (used in cases there this specific part has no IRI we can
      use to directly represent it, e.g. 'ESR1 transcript' q: polyA tail).

  context qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      Restricts the setting/context/location where the core concept (or qualified core concept) resides or occurs.

  direction qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      Composes with the core concept (+ aspect if provided) to describe a change in its direction or degree.

  statement qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    description: >-

  effect mechanism qualifier:
    is_a: statement qualifier
    description: >-
      A statement qualifier representing a type of molecular control mechanism through which an
      effect of a chemical on a gene or gene product is mediated (e.g. 'agonism', 'inhibition',
      'allosteric modulation', 'channel blocker')

  interaction mechanism qualifier:
    is_a: statement qualifier
    description: >-
      A statement qualifier representing a type of molecular interaction mechanism through which a
      physical interaction between chemical entities, genes, or gene products  occurred.

  anatomical context qualifier:
    is_a: statement qualifier
    description: >-
      A statement qualifier representing an anatomical location where an relationship expressed in an
      association took place (can be a tissue, cell type, or subcellular location).

  species context qualifier:
    is_a: statement qualifier
    description: >-
      A statement qualifier representing a taxonomic category of species in which a relationship
      expressed in an association took place.
